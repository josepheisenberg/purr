However, active measurements compete with other applications for limited network resources. These measurements are typically performed by individual users and applications, with limited coordination or planning. This dissertation addresses network measurement in the context of a measurement infrastructure, which can coordinate measurements, monitor and control their resource consumption, and even improve the quality of measurement results. We address three specific areas of operation in a measurement infrastructure. We present an architecture for an infrastructure that uses admission control to bound the resource consumption of measurements. We use estimates of the resources consumed by real-world measurement tools in the admission control mechanism. We evaluate methods of estimating the resource consumption of measurements in terms of network bandwidth, and show that these estimates are important to the accuracy of admission control. We propose several algorithms for determining when network measurements can be replaced by a network inference mechanism to reduce measurement load in the network at a cost of measurement accuracy. We experimentally evaluate these algorithms on measurement patterns designed to present difficulties, measurement patterns based on real-world peer-to-peer distributed communication, and random measurements. We show that the algorithms successfully reduce the measurement load on the first two types of graphs, and that they do not incur undue expense on the latter. We design and evaluate a family of methods for selecting vantage points from which to take active measurements to increase reachability into the Internet. We show that two of these methods perform substantially better than selecting vantage points at random, allowing a larger number of hosts to be probed with direct measurements with the same number of vantage points.</p>","computer science, inference, internet","Ethan L Blanton"

PFP shows overall better performance in predicting diverse moonlighting functions as compared with PSI-BLAST and ESG. Recall by PSI-BLAST greatly improved when BLOSUM45 was used. This analysis indicates that considering weakly similar sequences in prediction enhances the performance of sequence based AFP methods in predicting functional diversity of moonlighting proteins. The current study will also motivate development of novel computational frameworks for automatic identification of such proteins. This dataset was used for the evaluation of function predictions for moonlighting proteins. The dataset provides a set of 19 moonlighting proteins from Huberts et al. (2010) with GO annotations taken for each protein from Uniprot. The GO annotations for the proteins are classified as in &ldquo;Function 1&rdquo;, &ldquo;Function 2&rdquo;, &ldquo;Function Common to Both&rdquo; and &ldquo;Function Not Clear&rdquo;.

BMC Bioinformatics. 2010 May 19;11:265. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-11-265.","<p>BACKGROUND: A new paradigm of biological investigation takes advantage of technologies that produce large high throughput datasets, including genome sequences, interactions of proteins, and gene expression. The ability of biologists to analyze and interpret such data relies on functional annotation of the included proteins, but even in highly characterized organisms many proteins can lack the functional evidence necessary to infer their biological relevance. RESULTS: Here we have applied high confidence function predictions from our automated prediction system, PFP, to three genome sequences, Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Plasmodium falciparum (malaria). The number of annotated genes is increased by PFP to over 90% for all of the genomes. Using the large coverage of the function annotation, we introduced the functional similarity networks which represent the functional space of the proteomes. Four different functional similarity networks are constructed for each proteome, one each by considering similarity in a single Gene Ontology (GO) category, i.e. Biological Process, Cellular Component, and Molecular Function, and another one by considering overall similarity with the funSim score. The functional similarity networks are shown to have higher modularity than the protein-protein interaction network. Moreover, the funSim score network is distinct from the single GO-score networks by showing a higher clustering degree exponent value and thus has a higher tendency to be hierarchical. In addition, examining function assignments to the protein-protein interaction network and local regions of genomes has identified numerous cases where subnetworks or local regions have functionally coherent proteins. These results will help interpreting interactions of proteins and gene orders in a genome. Several examples of both analyses are highlighted. CONCLUSION: The analyses demonstrate that applying high confidence predictions from PFP can have a significant impact on a researchers&#39; ability to interpret the immense biological data that are being generated today. The newly introduced functional similarity networks of the three organisms show different network properties as compared with the protein-protein interaction networks.</p>","biochemistry, bioinformatics, computational biology / methods, genetic, molecular biosciences, proteins / metabolism","Troy Hawkins, Meghana Chitale, Daisuke Kihara"

Proteins. 2008 Nov 15;73(3):581-96. doi: 10.1002/prot.22082.","<p>Optimizing weighting factors for a linear combination of terms in a scoring function is a crucial step for success in developing a threading algorithm. Usually weighting factors are optimized to yield the highest success rate on a training dataset, and the determined constant values for the weighting factors are used for any target sequence. Here we explore completely different approaches to handle weighting factors for a scoring function of threading. Throughout this study we use a model system of gapless threading using a scoring function with two terms combined by a weighting factor, a main chain angle potential and a residue contact potential. First, we demonstrate that the optimal weighting factor for recognizing the native structure differs from target sequence to target sequence. Then, we present three novel threading methods which circumvent training dataset-based weighting factor optimization. The basic idea of the three methods is to employ different weighting factor values and finally select a template structure for a target sequence by examining characteristics of the distribution of scores computed by using the different weighting factor values. Interestingly, the success rate of our approaches is comparable to the conventional threading method where the weighting factor is optimized based on a training dataset. Moreover, when the size of the training set available for the conventional threading method is small, our approach often performs better. In addition, we predict a target-specific weighting factor optimal for a target sequence by an artificial neural network from features of the target sequence. Finally, we show that our novel methods can be used to assess the confidence of prediction of a conventional threading with an optimized constant weighting factor by considering consensus prediction between them.

Although most of them await elucidation of their function, it has been reported that some play important roles in gene regulation. Here we carried out comparative genomics analysis of possible sRNAs that are computationally identified in 30 bacterial genomes from gamma- and alpha-proteobacteria and Deinococcus radiodurans. Identified sRNAs are clustered by a complete-linkage clustering method to see conservation among the organisms. On average, sRNAs are found in approximately 30% of intergenic regions of each genome sequence. Of these, 25.7% are conserved among three or more organisms. Approximately 60% of the conserved sRNAs do not locate in orthologous intergenic regions, implying that sRNAs may be shuffled their positions in genomes. The current study implies that sRNAs may be involved in a more extensive range of functions in bacteria.</p>","bacterial, bacterial/genetics, biochemistry, bioinformatics, deinococcus/genetics, escherichiacoli/metabolism, molecular biosciences, multigene family, rna","Stan Luban, Daisuke Kihara"

Proteins. 2008 May 1;71(2):670-83.","<p>Experimentally determined protein tertiary structures are rapidly accumulating in a database, partly due to the structural genomics projects. Included are proteins of unknown function, whose function has not been investigated by experiments and was not able to be predicted by conventional sequence-based search. Those uncharacterized protein structures highlight the urgent need of computational methods for annotating proteins from tertiary structures, which include function annotation methods through characterizing protein local surfaces. Toward structure-based protein annotation, we have developed !VisGrid algorithm that uses the visibility criterion to characterize local geometric features of protein surfaces. Unlike existing methods, which only concerns identifying pockets that could be potential ligand-binding sites in proteins, !VisGrid is also aimed to identify large protrusions, hollows, and flat regions, which can characterize geometric features of a protein structure. The visibility used in !VisGrid is defined as the fraction of visible directions from a target position on a protein surface. A pocket or a hollow is recognized as a cluster of positions with a small visibility. A large protrusion in a protein structure is recognized as a pocket in the negative image of the structure. !VisGrid correctly identified 95.0% of ligand-binding sites as one of the three largest pockets in 5616 benchmark proteins. To examine how natural flexibility of proteins affects pocket identification, !VisGrid was tested on distorted structures by molecular dynamics simulation. Sensitivity decreased approximately 20% for structures of a root mean square deviation of 2.0 A to the original crystal structure, but specificity was not much affected. Because of its intuitiveness and simplicity, the visibility criterion will lay the foundation for characterization and function annotation of local shape of proteins.</p>","argininosuccinate synthase, binding sites, biochemistry, bioinformatics, computer simulation, molecular biosciences, protein structure, sensitivity and specificity, tertiary, tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/chemistry","Bin Li, Srinivasan Turuvekere, Manish Agrawal, Daisuke Kihara"

However, despite the availability of a large number of algorithms, their strengths and weaknesses are not sufficiently understood. Here, we designed a comprehensive set of performance measures and benchmarked five modern sequence-based motif discovery algorithms using large datasets generated from Escherichia coli !RegulonDB. Factors that affect the prediction accuracy, scalability and reliability are characterized. It is revealed that the nucleotide and the binding site level accuracy are very low, while the motif level accuracy is relatively high, which indicates that the algorithms can usually capture at least one correct motif in an input sequence. To exploit diverse predictions from multiple runs of one or more algorithms, a consensus ensemble algorithm has been developed, which achieved 6-45% improvement over the base algorithms by increasing both the sensitivity and specificity. Our study illustrates limitations and potentials of existing sequence-based motif discovery algorithms. Taking advantage of the revealed potentials, several promising directions for further improvements are discussed. Since the sequence-based algorithms are the baseline of most of the modern motif discovery algorithms, this paper suggests substantial improvements would be possible for them.</p>","algorithms, base sequence, binding sites, biochemistry, bioinformatics, computational biology / methods, dna/chemistry, dna/methods, escherichia coli/genetics, factors/metabolism, markov chains, markov chains regulatory sequences, molecular biosciences, regulon, sequence alignment, sequence analysis","Jianjun Hu, Bin Li, Daisuke Kihara"

Proteins: Structure, Function and Bioinformatics 64: 587-600. (2006)","<p>Aligning distantly related protein sequences is a long-standing problem in bioinformatics, and a key for successful protein structure prediction. Its importance is increasing recently in the context of structural genomics projects because more and more experimentally solved structures are available as templates for protein structure modeling. Toward this end, recent structure prediction methods employ profile-profile alignments, and various ways of aligning two profiles have been developed. More fundamentally, a better amino acid similarity matrix can improve a profile itself; thereby resulting in more accurate profile-profile alignments. Here we have developed novel amino acid similarity matrices from knowledge-based amino acid contact potentials. Contact potentials are used because the contact propensity to the other amino acids would be one of the most conserved features of each position of a protein structure. The derived amino acid similarity matrices are tested on benchmark alignments at three different levels, namely, the family, the superfamily, and the fold level. Compared to BLOSUM45 and the other existing matrices, the contact potential-based matrices perform comparably in the family level alignments, but clearly outperform in the fold level alignments. The contact potential-based matrices perform even better when suboptimal alignments are considered. Comparing the matrices themselves with each other revealed that the contact potential-based matrices are very different from BLOSUM45 and the other matrices, indicating that they are located in a different basin in the amino acid similarity matrix space.</p>","amino acids/chemistry, biochemistry, bioinformatics, molecular biosciences, protein folding","H.

Lett., 31, L08502, doi:10.1029/2003GL019282.","<p>Using transparent microfluidic cells to study the two-phase properties of a synthetic porous medium, we establish that the interfacial area per volume between nonwetting and wetting fluids lifts the ambiguity associated with the hysteretic relationship between capillary pressure and saturation in porous media. The interface between the nonwetting and wetting phases is composed of two subsets: one with a unique curvature determined by the capillary pressure, and the other with a distribution of curvatures dominated by disjoining pressure. This work provides experimental support for recent theoretical predictions that the capillary-dominated subset plays a role analogous to a state variable. Any comprehensive description of multiphase flow properties must include this interfacial area with the traditional variables of pressure and fluid saturation.

Development of pore network models based on detailed topological data of the pore space is essential for predicting multiphase flow in porous media. In this work, an unstructured pore network model has been developed to simulate a set of drainage and imbibition laboratory experiments performed on a two-dimensional micromodel. We used a pixel-based distance transform to determine medial pixels of the void domain of micromodel. This process provides an assembly of medial pixels with assigned local widths that simulates the topology of the porous medium. Using this pore network model, the capillary pressure-saturation and capillary pressure-interfacial area curves measured in the laboratory under static conditions were simulated. On the basis of several imbibition cycles, a surface of capillary pressure, saturation and interfacial area was produced. The pore network model was able to reproduce the distribution of the fluids as observed in the micromodel experiments. We have shown the utility of this simple pore network approach for capturing the topology and geometry of the micromodel pore structure.</p>","drainage, physics","V. Niasar, S. Hassanizadeh, Laura J.

For each applied pressure, the system established mechanical equilibrium characterized by stationary interfaces, uniform curvatures across the model, and random surface normals. To study the relationships among capillary pressure and the interfacial areas, we compare the curvature-based capillary pressure with the differential change in interfacial areas per volume as a function of wetting-phase saturation. The differential pressure contributions calculated from the experimental measurements are found to be nearly independent of the measured capillary pressure.

In recent years, Italian cinema has experienced a quiet revolution: the proliferation of films by women. But their thought-provoking work has not yet received the attention it deserves. Reframing Italy&#39;&#39; fills this gap. The book introduces readers to films and documentaries by recognized women directors such as Cristina Comencini, Wilma Labate, Alina Marazzi, Antonietta De Lillo, Marina Spada, and Francesca Comencini, as well as to filmmakers whose work has so far been undeservedly ignored. Through a thematically based analysis supported by case studies, Luciano and Scarparo argue that Italian women filmmakers, while not overtly feminist, are producing work that increasingly foregrounds female subjectivity from a variety of social, political, and cultural positions. This book, with its accompanying video interviews, explores the filmmakers&rsquo; challenging relationship with a highly patriarchal cinema industry. The incisive readings of individual films demonstrate how women&rsquo;s rich cinematic production reframes the aesthetic of their cinematic fathers, re-positions relationships between mothers and daughters, functions as a space for remembering women&rsquo;s (hi)stories, and highlights pressing social issues such as immigration and workplace discrimination.

A hallmark attribute of the WQFS is that within every treatment plot (10.8 by 48 m), a large drainage lysimeter (10.8 by 24.4 m) was constructed as a bottomless clay box to allow the collection of drainflow from a hydrologically isolated area of soil thereby permitting analyses of management impacts on losses of nutrients and other crop inputs to surface waters. Bentonite slurry was used to construct the walls of the clay box to a depth of 1.5 m; 0.1 m diameter agricultural drain tiles are installed at 0.9 m depth and all drainage water from a given plot is monitored continuously for drainage volume with composite samples collected on a 24-hr interval for constituent analyses. The experimental design for the facility is a randomized complete-block design with four replicates and 12 treatments (48 separately drained treatment plots). Eleven agricultural treatments are complemented by a restored prairie grass (PG) treatment, which serves as an analog for a natural ecosystem (Trt 1). The predominant species in Trt 1 is big bluestem (&#39;&#39;Andropogon gerardii&#39;&#39; Vitman). Between 1995 and 2006, all agricultural treatments include maize grown annually with no rotation to another crop (continuous corn (CC)) or maize grown in rotation with soybean (corn-soybean rotation (C/S)); in 2007/2008, a subset of treatments (Trt 2-5) were transitioned to candidate bioenergy systems (described elsewhere) with only one treatment retained in a maize-based system (Trt 3). Fertilizer N treatments feature varying rates, sources and application timings. For CC, inorganic N fertilizer management systems are generally as follows: (i) 202 kg N ha^-1^ applied preplant (Trt 3, 1995 &ndash; 2006), (ii) 179 kg N ha^-1^ applied preplant (Trt 12, 1995 &ndash; 2012), and (iii) 157 kg N ha^-1^ applied in a sidedress application after stand establishment and before the V6 growth stage (Trt 5, 1995 &ndash; 2007). For C/S rotations, the inorganic N fertilizer management systems require pairs of treatment plots so that both crops are present every study year; N managements are generally as follows: (i) 179 kg N ha^-1^ applied preplant (Trt 2 and 4, 1995 &ndash; 2007/2006), (ii) 157 kg N ha^-1^ applied preplant (Trt 6 and 7, 1995 &ndash; 2012), and (iii) 135 kg N ha^-1^ applied in a sidedress application after stand establishment and before V6 (Trt 8 and 9, 1995 &ndash; 2012). From 1997 onward, the source of inorganic N fertilizer was urea ammonium nitrate (UAN, 28% N) knifed in. Two additional CC treatments receive swine manure effluent as their source of N fertilizer with approximately 250 kg N ha^-1^ injected in the spring and fall to Trt 10 and 11, respectively. Liquid starter fertilizer containing N and P is applied to all corn plantings at a rate of 22 kg ha^&ndash;1^ N and 8 kg ha^&ndash;1^ P placed 5 cm to the side and 5 cm below the seed. Some deviation in these N managements occurred prior to 1997 and these deviations are noted in the data record. Thereafter, the management is maintained as described. The best commercial hybrids for the region are used in conjunction with best management practices for other nutrients and pest/pathogen and weed control.</p>","agronomy, continuous corn, corn soybean rotation, crop science, grain yield, nitrogen fertilizer, soil science, swine manure, water quality field station","Sylvie M.

These elements are relatively short and usually correspond to transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Numerous studies have worked on determining the genomic DNA sequences that control the expression of human genes. However, it has been difficult to pinpoint the protein binding sites along the human chromosomes via various experimental strategies including chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (!ChIPS). To develop a complementary approach, we reasoned that a priori one could expect that promoter regions would provide a rich source of data for designing tools to predict the position of regulatory signals de novo, based on DNA sequence alone. Towards this goal we designed a scheme to create density plots of sequences that appear frequently upstream of TSSs. The scheme involved the following steps. First, we created a database (RF_06_data) to collect all possible 9-mers (between positions -500 to -1) with respect to TSSs of protein-coding genes (the data included nearly 16,000 genes). To reduce sequence-redundancy, we selected the promoter of one mRNA isoform per gene. Since the human genome may contain multiple copies of a given gene, we selected one promoter to represent redundant genes. Second, we applied statistical criteria to rank the collected 9-mers with respect to their relative abundance in total human genomic DNA. Third, we wrote programs to create density plots to localize the occurrences of statistically significant 9-mers along the human chromosomes.&nbsp; We selected a 30-base-window and applied filtering criteria to scan each chromosome. The program examined all possible 9-mers in the 30-base-window to identify their statistically assigned ranks. The program used the ranks to compute a weighted sum. As the window moved along a chromosome (one base at a time), the weighted sums produced intensity values at each nucleotide position. Finally, a program was developed to create a file to display the density plots on a track on the genome browser at UCSC. This publication offers a link for viewing the density plots directly on the genome browser (hg19) and provides the corresponding file for download. The file is in bigWig format.

In consequence, any learning with an abundance of normal cases and a limited set of specific anomalous cases is biased towards the types of anomalies represented in the training set. Such models do not accurately identify anomalies, whether previously known or unknown, that may exist in future samples tested. Although one-class classifiers trained using only normal cases would avoid such a bias, robust sample characterization is critical for a generalizable model. Owing to sample heterogeneity and instrumental variability, arbitrary characterization of samples by feature extraction algorithms usually introduces feature noise that may lead to poor predictive performance. Herein, we present a non-parametric Bayesian algorithm called ASPIRE (anomalous sample phenotype identification with random effects) that identifies phenotypic differences across a batch of samples in the presence of random effects. Our approach involves simultaneous clustering of cellular measurements in individual samples and matching of discovered clusters across all samples in order to recover global clusters using probabilistic sampling techniques in a systematic way.&nbsp; Results: We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in identifying anomalous samples in two different FC data sets, one of which represents a set of samples including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases, and the other a generic 5-parameter peripheral-blood immunophenotyping. Results are evaluated in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). ASPIRE achieved AUCs of 0.99 and 1.0 on the AML and generic blood immunophenotyping data sets, respectively. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that anomalous samples can be identified by ASPIRE with almost perfect accuracy without {it a priori} access to samples of anomalous subtypes in the training set. The ASPIRE approach is unique in its ability to form generalizations regarding normal and anomalous states given only very weak assumptions regarding sample characteristics and origin. Thus, ASPIRE could become highly instrumental in providing unique insights about observed biological phenomena in the absence of full information about the investigated samples.</p>","aml, bayesian, biomedical engineering, bmc bioinformatics, computer science, cytometry, dirichlet process, gaussian mixture model, interdisciplinary research, life sciences, random effects","Murat Dundar, Ferit Akova, Halid Ziya Yerebakan, Bartlomiej P.

<p>This animation illustrates the use of the Link Pivot algorithm for optimizing offsets on a signalized arterial. The algorithm works by stepping through possible offsets at each intersection while trying to find the minimum delay or maximum arrivals on green. This effectively &ldquo;pivots&rdquo; across the possible configurations on the approaches on the next link. The offset achieving the optimal value is retained. The link flows previously optimized in the steps are maintained by applying the same adjustment on the current step to all prior intersections.</p>

The algorithm employs a physical formulation for the N-phase system that honors the conservations of mass and momentum and the second law of thermodynamics. We present a method for uniquely determining the mixing energy density coefficients involved in the N-phase model based on the pairwise surface tensions among the <em>N</em> fluids. Our numerical algorithm has several attractive properties that make it computationally very efficient: (i) it has completely de-coupled the computations for different flow variables, and has also completely de-coupled the computations for the <em>(N&minus;1)</em>phase field functions; (ii) the algorithm only requires the solution of linear algebraic systems after discretization, and no nonlinear algebraic solve is needed; (iii) for each flow variable the linear algebraic system involves only constant and time-independent coefficient matrices, which can be pre-computed during pre-processing, despite the variable density and variable viscosity of the N-phase mixture; (iv) within a time step the semi-discretized system involves only individual <em>de-coupled</em>Helmholtz-type (including Poisson) equations, despite the strongly-coupled phase&ndash;field system of fourth spatial order at the continuum level; (v) the algorithm is suitable for large density contrasts and large viscosity contrasts among the <em>N</em>fluids. Extensive numerical experiments have been presented for several problems involving multiple fluid phases, large density contrasts and large viscosity contrasts. In particular, we compare our simulations with the de Gennes theory, and demonstrate that our method produces physically accurate results for multiple fluid phases. We also demonstrate the significant and sometimes dramatic effects of the gravity, density ratios, pairwise surface tensions, and drop sizes on the <em>N</em>-phase configurations and dynamics. The numerical results show that the method developed herein is capable of dealing with <em>N</em>-phase systems with large density ratios, large viscosity ratios, and pairwise surface tensions, and that it can be a powerful tool for studying the interactions among multiple types of fluid interfaces.</p>","mathematics, multiphase flows, n-phase flow, phase field, physics, spectral element, surface tension","Suchuan Dong"

Reflectance measurements were acquired in the four Landsat wavelength bands through view zenith angles of 0, 7, 15, 22, 30, 45 and 60 degrees and view azimuth angles of 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315 degrees. The field of view of the Landsat band radiometer was 10 degrees and the vertical height of the multiband radiometer above the ground was ten meters. These data were collected for various solar zenith and azimuth angles during three days each representing a different development stage for the soybean canopy. Measurements were also made of leaf transmittance.</p>

<p>An ancillary data set was collected in conjunction with reflectance measurements to describe the soybean field by its canopy geometry, ground cover, biomass, leaf area index and development stage. These data sets satisfy the input requirements for testing the validity of most mathematical models of canopy reflectance.</p>

<p>Photographs were also obtained to coincide with each spectral observation.</p>

<p>1. Scene Type</p>

<p>The pair of numbers after &#39;SOYBEANS&#39; or &#39;BARE SOIL&#39; indicate the nominal view zenith and azimuth directions - zenith first, azimuth last. Nominal refers to the angles marked on the platform that were used for reference during data acquisition. The actual view zenith angle and azimuth angle are stored in the LARSPEC identification records under view zenith angle (VIZE) and view azimuth angle (VIAZ), respectively. The actual view zenith angle differs from the nominal view zenith angle for the first two days because the platform on which the Exotech 100 was rotated was not level. Therefore the view zenith angle changed for different view azimuth angles. On the third date of data collection a new mounting apparatus was used which made it possible to level the platform. Therefore the nominal view zenith angle and actual view zenith angle are the same for the third day.</p>

<p>2. Irradiance Azimuth Angle</p>

<p>This angle represents the direction of the solar disc measured clockwise from North. In other words it is the azimuthal angle from which the directional solar rays are coming.</p>

<p>3. Irradiance Zenith Angle</p>

<p>This angle represents the direction of the solar disc measured from a vertical line passing through the earth at the soybean field.</p>

<p>4. View Azimuth Angle</p>

<p>This angle represents the direction that the Exotech 100 Landsat band radiometer is viewing towards measured clockwise from North.</p>

<p>5. View Zenith Angle</p>

<p>This angle represents the direction that the Exotech 100 Landsat band radiomenter is viewing measured from a vertical line passing through the earth at the soybean field.</p>

The purpose was to investigate the effects of disease and nitrogen fertilization on the spectral and agronomic characteristics of winter wheat. There were three nitrogen fertilizer rates (0, 60, and 120 kg/hectare), and three disease treatments (resistant cultivar, susceptible cultivar) and susceptible cultivar treated with fungicide) with two replications in a randomized complete block design. Measurements of reflectance and radiant temperature of the wheat canopies were made with the Exotech 20C field spectroradiometer system and the Exotech 100 field radiometer system at approximately weekly intervals from tillering through ripe stages of development. Agronomic characterizations of the canopies included: leaf area index, biomass, percent soil cover, height lodging, disease severity, leaf nitrogen concentration, and grain yield.</p>

Different row directions were used to introduce varying amounts of shadow in the composite of foliage, soil and shadow viewed by a sensor.</p>

<p>An apparatus was built for this experiment, to allow a four meter diameter pseudo plot to be rotated beneath a Landsat band radiometer mounted 8.8 meters above the &#39;plot&#39;. The pseudo plot consisted of several .3 x .3 x .6 meter boxes of soybeans aligned in rows. The backgrounds were trays of Russell soils or boards painted with 3M flat black and 3M flat white to allow for a wide range in reflectance backgrounds. The pseudo plot is easily rotated to obtain any desired row direction.</p>

<p>Data were obtained for three soil covers, three backgrounds, and 37 row directions for several solar zenith-azimuth ranges. Data were collected on three different days.</p>

Southern corn leaf blight is an example of a non-systematic fungus disease capable of significantly reducing the photosynthesis capacity of corn. The specific objectives of the experiment were to determine the relationship of disease severity level to the spectral characteristics of corn. The factorial treatments included 2 Hybrids and 3 Leaf Blight Treatments (non, early and late inoculation). The early and late inoculation provided two different levels of disease severity at any given measurement date. The experiment was conducted using a randomized complete block design with two replications. After the disease became established (about July 1) measurements of reflectance and radiant temperatures were to be made with the Exotech 20C and PRT-5 sensors at weekly intervals until maturity. In addition to the standard agronomic characterization of the canopy the degree of infection (loss of green leaf area) was measured. Inclement weather in August and loss of one of the hybrids due to poor germination severely limited data collection on this experiment.</p>

A second plot was bare soil, providing an opportunity to monitor the reflectance of the soil background of the soybean plots. The remaining nine plots were planted in soybeans with 76 cm wide rows with the following azimuthal directions: 90-270, 105-285, 120- 300, 135-315, 150-330, 165-345, 180-360, 210-030, and 240-060 degrees.

<p>The general objective is to define quantitatively the relationships between soil reflectance and physiochemical properties of soils of significance to agriculture and engineering. Selection of soil samples with a wide rangeof important soil characteristics by statistical stratification of continental United States climatic zones permits the evaluation of climatic and genetic effects on the relationships between multispectral reflectance and these soil properties. A further objective is to define the relationships sufficiently to design further research to quantify the contributions which different soil components make to the multispectral characteristics of specific soils.</p>

<h2>Method:</h2>

<p>Because of the need to provide a uniform moisture condition for spectroradiometric analysis of the prepared soil samples, a procedure was chosen which creates a one-tenth bar soil moisturetension on all the soil samples (3,5). Two asbestos tension tables were constructed and a 100 cm column of water was established to create a soil moisture tension for up to 56 soil samples at one time. Sample holders were designed and constructed of plastic rings 2 cm deep by 10 cm in diameter with 60 mesh brass strainer cloth stretched taut and fastened in a countersunk groove in one end. Sample holders were painted with non-reflecting black paint to reduce unwanted reflection external to the target of interest. After saturation of the soil filled, leveled sample holders for about four hours, the samples were placed on the tension tables for 24 hours in order to reach equilibrium. The one-tenth bar moisture tension was desirable mainly for the ease with which large numbers of samples could be prepared at uniform moisture characteristics. Shortly after placement of each sample holder on the sample table of the reflectometer for spectral readings, a portion of the sample was transferred to a moisture tin, weighed, dried in a forced air oven at 105 C, weighed again, and moisture content reported as percentage of oven dry weight.</p>

<h2>Quantification of Soil Properties</h2>

<p>Modern soil classification systems emphasize the importance of information about the quantitative compositions of soils. In order to differentiate among soil groups, it is necessary to rely on laboratory measurements of selected soil properties. Physical, chemical, and engineering determinations of most soil properties follow well established procedures of laboratory analyses. Certain of these soil properties are selected as diagnostic criteria in the soil classification process, based on their importance in understanding the genesis of the soil. By a procedure of empirical correlation, critical limits between sets of soils are established, designed to reflect the influence of the soil forming factors of climate, parent material, relief, biological activity, and time.</p>

<p>Quantitative measurements of soil spectral properties have become available as a diagnostic tool for the soil scientist with the advent of such instruments as the Exotech Model 20C spectroradiometer. However, the climatic and genetic effects on the relationships between measured spectral properties and specific chemical, physical, and biological properties of the soil are not well understood. Whereas soil color is used as diagnostic criterion in the U.S. Soil Taxonomy (7), the determination of soil color by comparison with a color chart continues to be a rather nonquantitative and subject procedure. Spectral characterization of soil &quot;color&quot; by means of quantitative spectroradiometric measurements may add to the precision with which soils can be differentiated. With this increased precision of soil spectral characterization, the relationships with the more important diagnostic soil characteristics or qualities that are not so easily and accurately observed may be better understood.</p>

<h2>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH</h2>

<h3>Stratification and Sampling</h3>

<p>Approximately 250 soils, representing a statistical sampling of the more than 10,000 soil series in the United States were selected for this investigation. Selections were made from a list of the more than 1300 Benchmark soil series representing those soils with a large geographic extent and whose broad range of characteristics renders these soils so widely applicable for study. Stratification of soil sampling was based on series type location within climatic zones. Climatic strata included the frigid, mesic, thermic, and hyperthermic soil temperature regimes as defined by the U.S. Soil Taxonomy (2,6,7) as well as the perhumid, humid, subhumid, semiarid, and arid moisture regions as identified by Thornthwaite&#39;s 1948 Moisture Index (8). A random selection procedure was used within each stratified climatic zone to select a number of soils series approximately in proportion to the geographic extent of that region. Resulting sample distribution by climatic region for the soils actually received is shown in Table 1. Considerations were also made to include soils which represent the major parent material categories and the ten soils orders of the U.S. Soil Taxonomy (7). Table 2 presents the distribution of the Benchmark soil series on-hand according to soil parent material. As can be seen in Table 3, the distribution to Benchmark soils used for this study is very similar to the areal extent of the nine soil orders found in the continental United States (Oxisols being absent in the contiguous states).</p>

The experiment was established on the Managed Soil Moisture System (MSMS). The MSMS facility is a series of plastic-lined plots equipped with pipes and pumps so that water and/or nutrient supply can be controlled and either type of stress can be imposed on the crop (Reetz, et al. 1978). Spectral reflectance, radiant temperatures, and agronomic characterizations of the stressed and nonstressed canopies were acquired once per day at seven to 10 day intervals. On selected days during the season, reflectance, radiant temperature, and leaf water potential were measured four to eight times to monitor the diurnal changes in these parameters due to stress. More frequent rains then normal during the summer made establishment and maintenance of different levels of water stress nearly impossible. Short-term differences in soil moisture were established on several occasions in late July and August and radiant temperature and water potential were measured. However, much valuable experience on growing corn in the sand of the MSMS plots was gained.</p>

<p>Measurements of reflectance and radiant temperature of the wheat canopies were made with the exotech 20C field spectroradiometer system and the Exotech 100 Landsat band field radiometer system.

<p>Proper drainage is essential for pavement to maximize life expectancy and minimize maintenance. Culverts are a critical asset to facilitate drainage. As with many assets, culverts deteriorate with age and require regular inspection. It is important to have a formalized process of inventory and inspection that is efficient and can effectively support culvert asset management. The current culvert inspection and asset management processes for the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) have been modeled over the years on the bridge inspection process and were recently evaluated. A study was undertaken to further evaluate the current culvert asset management practices. Approximately 700 small culverts and catch basins were visited and evaluated using both the traditional culvert inspection practices and a revised asset management evaluation scale. The technical report and video summarize the findings of this evaluation and conclude by making recommendations for process improvements. These recommendations include the addition of photos to the culvert database, a revised rating scale, advanced planning of inspection schedules, a formalized process for culvert reassessments, the creation of a separate catch basin inlet inventory, various improvements to the inventory process, and a dedicated staff to complete inspections efficiently. It is also noted that building a reliable database will show historical trends and can eventually lead to a study of small culvert inspections and culvert longevity, which will lead to improved asset management.</p>","civil engineering, culvert inspection, purdue university","Darcy M.

The generalized form represents a family of open boundary conditions, which all ensure the energy stability of the system, even in situations where &nbsp;strong vortices or backflows occur at the open/outflow boundaries. Our numerical algorithm for treating these open boundary conditions is based on a rotational pressure correction-type strategy, with a formulation suitable for &nbsp;$C^0$ spectral-element spatial discretizations. We have introduced a discrete equation and associated boundary conditions for an auxiliary variable. The algorithm contains constructions that prevent a numerical locking at the open/outflow boundary. In addition, we have also developed a scheme with a provable unconditional stability for a sub-class of the open boundary conditions. Extensive numerical experiments have been presented to demonstrate the performance of our method for several flow problems involving open/outflow boundaries. We compare simulation results with the experimental data to demonstrate the accuracy of our algorithm. Long-time simulations have been performed for a range of Reynolds numbers at which strong vortices or backflows occur at the open/outflow boundaries. We show that the open boundary conditions and the numerical algorithm developed herein produce stable simulations in such situations.</p>

Reflectance measurements were acquired from 0.46 to 2.40 um using an Exotech model 20C spectroradiometer. at view zenith angles of 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 degrees and view azimuth angles of 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315 degrees. Spectral data and a photograph of the instrument field of view were taken in each of the 33 view directions. The field of view of the Exotech 20C was 15 degrees and the vertical height of the system above the soil was 7.6 meters. These data were collected for various solar zenith and azimuth angles during five days each representing a different development stage for the spring wheat canopy. Measurements were also made of leaf transmittance. An ancillary data set was collected in conjunction with reflectance measurements to describe the spring wheat field by its canopy geometry, ground cover, biomass, leaf area index and development stage.</p>

<p>On two of the four days, June 19 and July 17, polarization measurements were collected. The polarization data for these days only include wavelengths from 0.46-0.72 um since the polarizing material that was used was only good for the visible wavelengths. A polarization analyzer, a sheet of polarizing film mounted in a rotateable bracket, was attached to the spectroradiometer at the entrance port. In each view direction, two spectra were acquired, one with the polarization analyzer oriented for maximum detector signal amplitude and the other with the analyzer oriented for minimum signal. See reference for details of an analysis of this polarization data.</p>

<p>An apparatus was built for this experiment, to allow a four meter diameter pseudo plot to be rotated beneath a Landsat band radiometer mounted 8.8 meters above the &quot;plot&quot;. The pseudo plot consisted of several .3 x .3 x .6 meter boxes of soybeans aligned in rows. The backgrounds were trays of Russell soils or boards painted with 3M flat black and 3M flat white to allow for a wide range in reflectance backgrounds. The pseudo plot is easily rotated to obtain any desired row direction.</p>

<p>Data were obtained for three soil covers, three backgrounds, and 72 row directions for several solar zenith-azimuth ranges. Data were collected on three different days.</p>

<p>Rationale</p>

<p>In recent years the world&#39;s food situation has emphasized the need for timely information on world-wide crop production. Relatively few countries, however, have reliable methods for gathering and reporting crop production information.</p>

<p>Remote sensing from aerospace platforms can provide information about crops and soils which could be useful to crop production forecasting systems. The feasibility of utilizing multispectral data from satellites to identify and measure crop area has been demonstrated; however, relatively little research has been conducted on developing the capability of using multispectral data to provide information about crop condition and yield. If this spectrally derived information can be combined effectively with crop models which depict limitations imposed on crop yields by weather and climate, then potentially much better information about crop yield and production can be gained.</p>

<p>Literature Review</p>

<p>Solar radiation is an important energy source for photosynthesis, the process which governs the growth and production of plants. Numerous studies have found positive correlation between photosynthesis (or C02 assimilation) and the amount and/or intensity of solar radiation incident on a crop canopy (2, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 18). More recent works (3, 11) have concentrated on the relationship between photosynthesis and the amount of incident solar radiation that is intercepted and thereby available for utilization by the plants (ISR). Both SR and ISR, however, have been shown to be positively correlated with increases in plant matter as well as final grain yield (6, 7, 12, 15, 19, 20, 22, 23).</p>

<p>The interaction of SR with a crop canopy is a function of the amount of vegetative matter present, geometric configuration of the canopy, and solar zenith and azimuth angles (Norman, 1980). The amount of crop canopy vegetation present in a given area is often described by the leaf area index (LAI) or the percent crop cover (PCC). Most model estimates of crop canopy ISR involve measurement of some, or all, of the above variables. Measurement of these variables, however, is tedious and time consuming. The direct measurement of light interception by a canopy has been found to be a more direct and simpler approach (Hesketh and Baker, 1967).</p>

<p>A more simple method of estimating the amount of light intercepted by a canopy may be through remote sensing of canopy reflectance, as canopy reflectance is a function of many of the same variables that govern ISR. Daughtry et al. (1982) estimated ISR</p>

<p>ISR = 1 - exp (-0.79 LAI)</p>

<p>where LAI is the measured leaf area index and 0.79 is the extinction coefficient used by Linvill et al. Seasonal ISR was regressed on spectral variables which were computed from reflectance measurements made over the corn crop canopy through the growing season. A coefficient of determination of 0.90 was ascertained for the quadratic relationship between ISR and the spectral variable Greenness Index (Malila and Gleason, 1977). In actuality only about 50% of the SR intercepted by a crop canopy causes a photosynthetic response. The portion of the SR spectral which activates photosynthesis has been defined as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), with a waveband ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 um (Monteith, 1969). IPAR rather than ISR is therefore the preferred measure of canopy interception of radiation.</p>

<p>IPAR (or ISR) is only one of a number of factors which influence crop growth and final yield. Other factors essential to crop growth and production include temperature, moisture availability, plant nutrients, carbon dioxide and management practices. Due to its importance as an energy source for photosynthesis, and in turn crop growth and production, IPAR (or ISR) is a factor included in many models of crop growth and production (1, 4, 20, 21).</p>

<p>Objectives</p>

<p>The overall objectives of this research are 1) the identification and measurement of corn crop canopy variables which are related to crop growth and final yield, 2) development of relationships between variables identified in Objective 1 and remotely sensed canopy spectral reflectance, and 3) development and testing of methods for combining spectral and meteorological data in corn crop yield models which are capable of providing accurate estimates of crop conditions and yield potential, throughout the growing season.</p>

<p>This video illustrates the growth of a fatigue crack at a detail susceptible to out-of-plane distortion cracking. (Note: Cracking is not observed until after 70,000 cycles are applied.) As expected, once cracking is initiated, growth is relatively fast and accelerates with extension of the crack. During the test, the detail was cycled both in and out of plane (i.e., the loading produced by the actuator resulted in positive and negative applied stresses at the weld toe.) However, only images that recorded the opening of the crack are used to show the extension of the crack.</p>","civil engineering, fatigue crack growth, fatigue cracking, out-of-plane distortion cracking","Luke Snyder, Julie Whitehead, Robert J.

<p>This video illustrates a brittle fracture which occurs in a laboratory test of a bridge girder from a retired railroad flat car. The girder was notched and cooled using liquid nitrogen to well below -100F to ensure the steel was on the lower shelf. Load was applied to produce the fracture. Later in the video, images that were captured using a high-speed camera show the actual fracture propagation through the depth of the girder. At 10,000 frames per second, still only 3 to 5 frames capture the entire fracture event, illustrating the extremely fast crack propagation rate of such an event.</p>","brittle fracture, civil engineering, girder fracture","Teresa Washeleski, Robert J.

<p>This video shows a test in the laboratory in which a 1-inch-thick cover plate was fractured. During the test, the specimen was cooled to -80F to ensure that all materials were on the lower shelf. Then, load was applied to a stress of 0.55F<sub>y</sub>, but no fracture occurred. Next, the specimen was cycled a number of times between 0.45F<sub>y</sub> and 0.55F<sub>y</sub>, but again no fracture occurred. Finally, the wedges were driven into the notch in the cover plate. (This device can be seen attached to the bottom flange.). Under the full load of 0.55F<sub>y</sub>, the cover plate fractured after the wedges were driven using a hydraulic ram. After fracture, the stress on the remaining net section was slightly greater than F<sub>y</sub>. The fracture in the cover plate did not &ldquo;jump&rdquo; into the remaining components (i.e., the angles and web plate), indicating that member-level redundancy was present.</p>","brittle fracture, civil engineering, girder fracture, member-level redundancy","Cem Korkmas, Matt Hebdon, Robert J.

Reflectance measurements were acquired in the three Landsat Thematic Mapper wavelength bands plus a 1.15-1.30 &micro;m band at view zenith angles of 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 65 degrees and view azimuth angles of 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315 degrees. One data set consists of two replications of 44 view angles each. The radiometers were mounted on top of a tower in the middle of the sorghum field. The tower system is described by Jon Ranson in &quot;Sun-View Angle Effects on Reflectance Factors of Corn Canopies&quot;, Remote Sensing of Environment, 18:147-161 (1985).</p>

<p>The field of view of the two Barnes 12-1000 multiband radiometers that were used was 15 degrees and the vertical height of the multiband radiometer was 5.9 meters above the ground. These data were collected for various solar zenith and azimuth angles during two days. An ancillary data set was collected in conjunction with reflectance measurements to describe the sorghum field by its canopy geometry, ground cover, biomass, leaf area index and development stage. Vern Vanderbilt has this information.</p>

<p>The data were collected with a pair of Barnes 12-1000 multiband radiometers that contained a modified set of wavelength filters and polarizers. Barnes-105 contained three 0.45-0.52 &micro;m wavelength filters with polarizer film oriented at three different angles mounted on the front plate of the instrument. In other words the light would pass through the polarizer film first and then through the wavelength filters. Barnes-105 also contained three 2.08-2.35 &micro;m wavelength filters. with polarizer film oriented at three different angles. In addition, data were collected with a 0.76-0.90 &micro;m wavelength band with no polarizer film.</p>

<p>Barnes-108 contained three 0.63-0.69 &micro;m wavelength filters with polarizer film oriented at three different angles, two 1.15-1.30 &micro;m wavelength filters and one 1.55-1.75 &micro;m wavelength filter with polarizer film oriented at three different angles (The 1.55-1.75 filter was supposed to have been a 1.15-1.30 filter; the error was not noticed until after the data had been collected.)</p>

<p>No data were collected with the Barnes thermal channels. The three relative polarizer angles were 0, 45 and 90 degrees. One can determine what the polarization is by using the measurements from the three polarizing angles.</p>

<p>The data collection for the first day, 9-27-83, was considered practice.</p>

<p>Rationale</p>

<p>In recent years the world&#39;s food situation has emphasized the need for timely information on world-wide crop production. Relatively few countries, however, have reliable methods for gathering and reporting crop production information.</p>

<p>Remote sensing from aerospace platforms can provide information about crops and soils which could be useful to crop production forecasting systems. The feasibility of utilizing multispectral data from satellites to identify and measure crop area has been demonstrated; however, relatively little research has been conducted on developing the capability of using multispectral data to provide information about crop condition and yield. If this spectrally derived information can be combined effectively with crop models which depict limitations imposed on crop yields by weather and climate, then potentially much better information about crop yield and production can be gained.</p>

<p>Literature Review</p>

<p>Solar radiation is an important energy source for photosynthesis, the process which governs the growth and production of plants. Numerous studies have found positive correlation between photosynthesis (or C02 assimilation) and the amount and/or intensity of solar radiation incident on a crop canopy (2, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 18). More recent works (3, 11) have concentrated on the relationship between photosynthesis and the amount of incident solar radiation that is intercepted and thereby available for utilization by the plants (ISR). Both SR and ISR, however, have been shown to be positively correlated with increases in plant matter as well as final grain yield (6, 7, 12, 15, 19, 20, 22, 23).</p>

<p>The interaction of SR with a crop canopy is a function of the amount of vegetative matter present, geometric configuration of the canopy, and solar zenith and azimuth angles (Norman, 1980). The amount of crop canopy vegetation present in a given area is often described by the leaf area index (LAI) or the percent crop cover (PCC). Most model estimates of crop canopy ISR involve measurement of some, or all, of the above variables. Measurement of these variables, however, is tedious and time consuming. The direct measurement of light interception by a canopy has been found to be a more direct and simpler approach (Hesketh and Baker, 1967).</p>

<p>A more simple method of estimating the amount of light intercepted by a canopy may be through remote sensing of canopy reflectance, as canopy reflectance is a function of many of the same variables that govern ISR. Daughtry et al. (1982) estimated ISR</p>

<p>ISR = 1 - exp (-0.79 LAI)</p>

<p>where LAI is the measured leaf area index and 0.79 is the extinction coefficient used by Linvill et al. Seasonal ISR was regressed on spectral variables which were computed from reflectance measurements made over the corn crop canopy through the growing season. A coefficient of determination of 0.90 was ascertained for the quadratic relationship between ISR and the spectral variable Greenness Index (Malila and Gleason, 1977). In actuality only about 50% of the SR intercepted by a crop canopy causes a photosynthetic response. The portion of the SR spectral which activates photosynthesis has been defined as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), with a waveband ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 um (Monteith, 1969). IPAR rather than ISR is therefore the preferred measure of canopy interception of radiation.</p>

<p>IPAR (or ISR) is only one of a number of factors which influence crop growth and final yield. Other factors essential to crop growth and production include temperature, moisture availability, plant nutrients, carbon dioxide and management practices. Due to its importance as an energy source for photosynthesis, and in turn crop growth and production, IPAR (or ISR) is a factor included in many models of crop growth and production (1, 4, 20, 21).</p>

<p>Objectives</p>

<p>The overall objectives of this research are 1) the identification and measurement of corn crop canopy variables which are related to crop growth and final yield, 2) development of relationships between variables identified in Objective 1 and remotely sensed canopy spectral reflectance, and 3) development and testing of methods for combining spectral and meteorological data in corn crop yield models which are capable of providing accurate estimates of crop conditions and yield potential, throughout the growing season.</p>

This experiment is a continuation of the sorghum polarization experiment begun in 1983. Reflectance measurements were acquired in the three Landsat Thematic Mapper wavelength bands plus a 1.15-1.30 &micro;m band at view zenith angles of 0, 7, 15, 22, 30, 45, 60 and 70 or 75 degrees and view azimuth angles of 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315 degrees. If the view azimuth angle was diagonal to the field boundaries, the maximum view zenith angle was 75 degrees. If the view azimuth angle was perpendicular to the field boundaries, the maximum view zenith angle was 70 degrees. One data set consists of two replications of 60 view angles each. The radiometers were mounted on top of a tower in the middle of the sorghum field. The tower system is described by Jon Ranson in &quot;Sun-View Angle Effects on Reflectance Factors of Corn Canopies&quot;, Remote Sensing of Environment, 18:147-161 (1985).</p>

<p>The field of view of the two Barnes 12-1000 multiband radiometers that were used was 15 degrees and the vertical height of the multiband radiometer was 5.9 meters above the ground. These data were collected for various solar zenith and azimuth angles during four days representing before and after heading development stages. An ancillary data set was collected in conjunction with reflectance measurements to describe the sorghum field by its canopy geometry, ground cover, biomass, leaf area index and development stage. Vern Vanderbilt has this information.</p>

<p>The data were collected with a pair of Barnes 12-1000 multiband radiometers that contained a modified set of wavelength filters and polarizers. For the August dates, Barnes-105 contained three 0.45-0.52 &micro;m wavelength filters with polarizer film oriented at three different angles mounted on the front plate of the instrument. In other words the light would pass through the polarizer film first and then through the wavelength filters. Barnes-105 also contained three 2.08-2.35 &micro;m wavelength filters. with polarizer film oriented at three different angles. In addition, data were collected with a 0.76-0.90 &micro;m wavelength band with no polarizer film. For the September 19th date, the three 2.08-2.25 &micro;m bands were replaced with three 1.55-1.75 &micro;m bands.</p>

<p>Barnes-108 contained three 0.63-0.69 &micro;m wavelength filters with polarizer film oriented at three different angles and three 1.15-1.30 &micro;m wavelength filters with polarizer film oriented at three different angles. In addition, data were collected with a 0.52-0.60 &micro;m wavelength band with no polarizer film.</p>

<p>No data were collected with the Barnes thermal channels. The three relative polarizer angles were 0, 45 and 90 degrees. One can determine what the polarization is by using the measurements from the three polarizing angles.</p>

<p>The data for the first day, 8-17-84, was done under overcast conditions.</p>

<p>LARSPEC Identification Record Codes</p>

<p>1. Scene Type</p>

<p>The pair of numbers after &#39;SORGHUM&#39; indicate the view zenith and azimuth directions - azimuth first, zenith last. The view zenith and azimuth angles are also stored in the LARSPEC identification records under view zenith angle (VIZE) and view azimuth angle (VIAZ), respectively.</p>

<p>2. Irradiance Azimuth Angle</p>

<p>This angle represents the direction of the solar disc measured clockwise from North. In other words it is the azimuthal angle from which the directional solar rays are coming.</p>

<p>3. Irradiance Zenith Angle</p>

<p>This angle represents the direction of the solar disc measured from a vertical line passing through the earth at the sorghum field.</p>

<p>4. View Azimuth Angle</p>

<p>This angle represents the direction that the Barnes multiband radiometer is viewing towards measured clockwise from North.</p>

<p>5. View Zenith Angle</p>

<p>This angle represents the direction that the Barnes multiband radiometer is viewing measured from a vertical line passing through the earth at the sorghum field.</p>

In 2011, the USDA funded the Climate and Corn-based Cropping Systems CAP (CSCAP) and Useful to Usable (U2U): Transforming Climate Variability and Change Information for Cereal Crop Producers projects. CSCAP seeks to increase resilience and adaptability of Midwest agriculture to more volatile weather patterns by identifying famer practices and policies that increase sustainability while meeting crop demand. U2U seeks to increase resilience and adaptability of Midwestern agriculture by improving the usability and uptake of climate information.</p>

<p>The U2U-CSCAP survey was sent to a stratified random sample of 18,707 farmers with at least US$100,000 of gross sales and a minimum of 80 acres of corn production in 22 six-digit Hydrologic Code Unit (HUC) watersheds (see Appendix A of the Farmer Perspectives on Agriculture and Weather Variability in the Corn Belt Appendix Statistical Atlas for a comprehensive account of survey methods). The 22 watersheds cover a substantial portion of 11 Corn Belt states&mdash;Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin&mdash;all of which are classified as &ldquo;major crop areas&rdquo; for corn and soybean (USDA 1994). Completed surveys were received from 4,778 farmers for an effective response rate of 26%.</p>

<p>Continuing the format of this atlas series, this document provides additional findings of the U2U-CSCAP survey results by watershed. Each section contains a tabulated presentation of survey data and a series of maps that visually represent the distribution of responses across the entire study region.</p>

<p>The first atlas in this series presented data on farmer attitudes toward adaptive and mitigative action, farmer beliefs about climate change, farmers&rsquo; perceptions of risks and experienced hazards, influences of agricultural actors, the capacity of farmers to deal with climate change and weather-related threats, characteristics of the farms surveyed, and general information regarding weather and marginal soils in the study watersheds. This second atlas provides additional results from the 2012 survey. Here, we focus upon farmers&rsquo; specific behaviors, beliefs about climate and weather, and the tools they utilize to make farm decisions. In the following pages you will find information covering timing of farming practices and farming decisions, whether and how farmers use weather information when making farming decisions, a detailed look at the influence of agricultural advisors in farmer decision making processes, farmers&rsquo; personal experiences regarding weather and risks, additional information on farmers&rsquo; attitudes and beliefs regarding climate change, and plans and efforts of farmers to adapt to and manage for weather and climate variability and risk.</p>

<p>As with the first atlas in this series, it is our hope that the maps in this document will be useful to Extension educators and other stakeholders that work with the agricultural community. To lift a map for use in a PowerPoint presentation or other document, simply use the &ldquo;Take a Snapshot&rdquo; tool in the Edit Menu of Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat to capture the image, then paste it into your presentation or other document. If you require higher resolution images than your default settings provide, go to the Edit Menu, then Preferences, then General.

<p>The purpose of this experiment was to characterize the polarization of a 100 meter by 100 meter sunflower plot at the Montfavet INRA facility. The polarization data along with many other canopy measurements will serve as a basis for research involving the spectral, directional and polarization characteristics of reflected light. Data from three Barnes 12-1000 and four Cimel multiband radiometers were collected on 10 dates during July and early August. Reflectance polarization measurements were acquired in five Landsat Thematic Mapper wavelength bands (0.45-0.52 um, 0.52-0.60 um, 0.63-0.69 um, 0.76-0.90 um, 1.55-1.75 um) plus a 1.15-1.30 um band and 3 SPOT bands (0.50-0.59 um, 0.62-0.68 um, 0.79-0.89 um). Measurements were collected for view zenith angles at about every 2 degrees from 0 to 70 degrees and view azimuth angles of 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315 degrees and 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees relative to the solar illumination azimuth angle. Polarization measurements were also made of the sky conditions for view zenith angles at about every 2 degrees from 180 (straight up) to 110 degrees and view azimuth angles of 90, 180, and 270 degrees relative to the solar azimuth.</p>

<p>The radiometers were mounted on a 13.5 meter tower in the middle of the sunflower canopy. A set of sunflower measurements consists of 2 reps of 12 azimuth angles. A set of sky data consists of 3 azimuth angles. No data were collected for the azimuth angle towards the sun so as not to risk damaging the detectors.</p>

<p>The field of view of the Barnes multiband radiometers was 1 degree; the field of view of one Cimel that had no polarizing filters was 12 degrees. The field of view of the three Cimel multiband radiometers that contained polarizing filters was 1 degree before 7/25 and 12 degrees on 7/25 and thereafter. The data were collected from a height of 13.5 meters above the canopy. There were three channels of data collected for each of the nine wavelength bands listed above each having a polarizing film oriented at a different angle The three relative polarizer angles were 0, 45 and 90 degrees. Data were also collected for 6 wavelength bands with no polarizing film (0.50-0.59 um, 0.62-0.68 um, 0.79-0.89 um and 3 of 2.08-2.35 um).</p>

<p>Other measurements collected in conjunction with the reflectance measurements included leaf reflectance and transmittance, biomass, leaf area index, development stage.</p>

Here, we present a new method, namely the irregular-resampling auto-spectral analysis (IRASA), to separate fractal and oscillatory components in the power spectrum of neurophysiological signal according to their distinct temporal and spectral characteristics. In this method, we irregularly resampled the neural signal by a set of non-integer factors, and statistically summarized the auto-power spectra of the resampled signals to separate the fractal component from the oscillatory component in the frequency domain. We tested this method on simulated data and demonstrated that IRASA could robustly separate the fractal component from the oscillatory component. In addition, applications of IRASA to macaque electrocor- ticography and human magnetoencephalography data revealed a greater power-law exponent of fractal dynamics during sleep compared to wakefulness. The temporal fluctuation in the broadband power of the fractal compo- nent revealed characteristic dynamics within and across the eyes-closed, eyes-open and sleep states. These results&nbsp;demonstrate the efficacy and potential applications of this method in analyzing electrophysiological signatures of large-scale neural circuit activity. We expect that the pro- posed method or its future variations would potentially allow for more specific characterization of the differential contributions of oscillatory and fractal dynamics to dis- tributed neural processes underlying various brain functions.&nbsp;</span></p>","bioinformatics, biomedical engineering, fractal, scale-free","Zhongming Liu, Haiguang Wen"

We investigate the effect of data augmentation as well as feature extraction with multiple patch sizes and at different image scales on the classifier performance. Our data set includes 1833 images from four different classes of bacteria with each bacterial culture captured at three different wavelengths and overall data collected during a three-day period. Limited number and diversity of images present, potential random effects across multiple days, and multi-mode nature of class distributions pose a challenging setting for representation learning. When we use images collected first day for training, second day for validation, and third day for testing K-means-based representation learning achieves 97% classification accuracy on the test data. This compares very favorably to 56% accuracy achieved by deep learning and 74% accuracy achieved by handcrafted features. Our results suggest that data augmentation or dropping connections between units offer little help for deep learning algorithms whereas significant boost can be achieved by K-means-based representation learning by augmenting data and by concatenating features obtained at multiple patch sizes or image scales.<!--EndFragment--></p>","bacterial colonies, bardot, biomedical engineering, computer science, deep learning, elastic light scattering, interdisciplinary research, k-means clustering, life sciences, machine learning, representation learning","Yicheng He, Baichuan Zhang, Qiang Kou, Murat Dundar, Bartlomiej P.

<p>Agricultural advisors are technical specialists who advise corn farmers on a variety of issues such as farm management practices, conservation practices, and economic issues. This includes certified crop advisors, soil scientists, agricultural retailers, bankers, grower groups, university extension, USDA Farm Service Agency staff, Natural Resource Conservation Service staff, agricultural cooperatives, agricultural lawyers, county weed supervisors, local conservation districts, State Department of Agriculture staff, and State Department of Environment/Natural Resources staff. Contact lists for this survey were primarily generated manually from relevant organization and agency websites. In a few cases the organization either provided us with contacts lists or distributed invitations to their members to participate in the survey. In total 5,478 advisors received the 2013 survey and 1,703 responded. A screening question was used to determine which respondents directly advise corn farmers.</p>

A series of open-ended interview questions were used to broach a diversity of inter-related, yet distinct, topics such as climate beliefs, financial considerations, Farm Bill impacts, and more.</p>

<p>Agricultural advisors are technical specialists who advise corn farmers on a variety of issues such as farm management practices, conservation practices, and economic issues. Agricultural advisors interviewed for this study include Certified Crop Advisors (CCAs), staff at conservation agencies, agricultural bankers, and university Extension personnel located in Indiana, Iowa, and Nebraska. With the exception of agricultural bankers, interviewees were selected from a list of advisors who completed the 2012 climate needs assessment survey (for details see Prokopy, L.S. et al. 2013. &ldquo;Agricultural Advisors: A Receptive Audience for Weather and Climate Information?&rdquo; Weather, Climate, and Society, 5:162-167). Agricultural bankers were identified by manually contacting relevant organizations. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Early childhood growth has many downstream effects on future health and reproduction and is an important measure of offspring quality. While a tradeoff between family size and child growth outcomes is theoretically predicted in high-fertility societies, empirical evidence is mixed.&nbsp; This is often attributed to phenotypic variation in parental condition.&nbsp; However, inconsistent study results may also arise because family size confounds the potentially differential effects that older and younger siblings can have on young children&rsquo;s growth. Additionally, inconsistent results might reflect that the biological significance associated with different growth trajectories is poorly understood. This paper addresses these concerns by tracking children&rsquo;s monthly gains in height and weight from weaning to age five in a high fertility Maya community.&nbsp; We predicted that: 1) as an aggregate measure family size will not have a major impact on child growth during the post weaning period; 2) competition from young siblings will negatively impact child growth during the post weaning period; 3) however because of their economic value, older siblings will have a negligible effect on young children&rsquo;s growth. Accounting for parental condition, we use linear mixed models to evaluate the effects that family size, younger and older siblings have on children&rsquo;s growth.&nbsp; Congruent with our expectations, it is younger siblings that have the most detrimental effect on children&rsquo;s growth.&nbsp; While we find statistical evidence of a quantity/quality tradeoff effect, the biological significance of these results is negligible in early childhood. Our findings help to resolve why quantity/quality studies have had inconsistent results by showing that sibling competition varies with sibling age composition, not just family size, and differs for children growing up in traditional and labor-market economies.&nbsp;</p>

In 2012 the Engineering Administration Building (ENAD) and the iconic Heat and Power Plant-North (HPN) were targeted for demolition to make way for the construction of the Wilmeth Active Learning Center (WALC); a building with offices, collaborative spaces and classrooms with an emphasis on new instructional models. The Purdue University Lyles School of Civil Engineering capitalized on a key opportunity for education and research. Five cameras were installed to capture images from the demolition of the Engineering Administration Building and the Power Plant, to the construction of the Wilmeth Active Learning Center.

<p>Purdue&#39;s campus landscape continues to change with the construction of new buildings and the remodel of old buildings. In 2012 the Engineering Administration Building (ENAD) and the iconic Heat and Power Plant-North (HPN) were targeted for demolition to make way for the construction of the Active Learning Center (ALC); a building with offices, collaborative spaces and classrooms with an emphasis on new instructional models. The Purdue University Lyles School of Civil Engineering capitalized on a key opportunity for education and research. Five cameras were installed to capture images from the demolition of the Engineering Administration Building and the Power Plant, to the construction of the Active Learning Center. The images from 3 fixed cameras situated on the Mathematical Sciences Building (MATH) and the Potter (A. A.) Engineering Center (POTR) can be accessed and used for educational and research purposes.</p>

One GPS point was taken to serve for the location. Rauh then triaged the collection according to diagnostically useful specimens. In all some 16 collection areas were investigated at Selinus. The pottery was then brought back to the laboratory where it was cleaned, coded, and photographed as groups. In 1997 the pottery was read by both Richard Rothaus and Kathleen Slane. Materials that were deemed as too worn or damaged to keep were returned to the field.The remainder were stored in bags for years on site before being moved to the Alanya Archaeological Museum. At the beginning of the 1998 season, Rauh revisited some of the collection areas where new materials were exposed from recent ploughing and performed a recollection. Rauh, Matt Dillon, and students went through all the surviving bags in 2014 to photograph, measure, Munsell, and describe each surviving sherd.

<p>Purdue&#39;s campus landscape continues to change with the construction of new buildings and the remodel of old buildings. In 2012 the Engineering Administration Building (ENAD) and the iconic Heat and Power Plant-North (HPN) were targeted for demolition to make way for the construction of the Active Learning Center (ALC); a building with offices, collaborative spaces and classrooms with an emphasis on new instructional models. The Purdue University Lyles School of Civil Engineering capitalized on a key opportunity for education and research. Five cameras were installed to capture images from the demolition of the Engineering Administration Building and the Power Plant, to the construction of the Active Learning Center.

<p>Purdue&#39;s campus landscape continues to change with the construction of new buildings and the remodel of old buildings. In 2012 the Engineering Administration Building (ENAD) and the iconic Heat and Power Plant-North (HPN) were targeted for demolition to make way for the construction of the Wilmeth Active Learning Center (WALC); a building with offices, collaborative spaces and classrooms with an emphasis on new instructional models. The Purdue University Lyles School of Civil Engineering capitalized on a key opportunity for education and research. Five cameras were installed to capture images from the demolition of the Engineering Administration Building and the Power Plant, to the construction of the Wilmeth Active Learning Center. The images from 3 fixed cameras situated on the Mathematical Sciences Building (MATH) and the Potter (A. A.)

<p>Purdue&#39;s campus landscape continues to change with the construction of new buildings and the remodel of old buildings. In 2012 the Engineering Administration Building (ENAD) and the iconic Heat and Power Plant-North (HPN) were targeted for demolition to make way for the construction of the Wilmeth Active Learning Center (WALC); a building with offices, collaborative spaces and classrooms with an emphasis on new instructional models. The Purdue University Lyles School of Civil Engineering capitalized on a key opportunity for education and research. Five cameras were installed to capture images from the demolition of the Engineering Administration Building and the Power Plant, to the construction of the Wilmeth Active Learning Center. The images from 3 fixed cameras situated on the Mathematical Sciences Building (MATH) and the Potter (A. A.) Engineering Center (POTR) can be accessed and used for educational and research purposes.</p>

Five cameras were installed to capture images from the demolition of the Engineering Administration Building and the Power Plant, to the construction of the Wilmeth Active Learning Center. The images from 3 fixed cameras situated on the Mathematical Sciences Building (MATH) and the Potter (A. A.) Engineering Center (POTR) can be accessed and used for educational and research purposes.</p>

<p>Representative time lapse videos were created from these three cameras for each month of the project. The time lapse videos created from these images - 08:00 to 18:00, 7 days a week in each month - are accessible here: <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.4231/R70P0WXD"">http://dx.doi.org/10.4231/R70P0WXD</a>.</p>","active learning center construction, building construction, building construction management, civil engineering, construction time-lapse, enadalc, purdue university, walc, wilmeth active learning center","David Burford, Alexander M.

Biotechnology for Biofuels","<p align=""left""><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p align=""left"">Monolignol-like molecules can be integrated into lignin along with conventional monolignol units, and it has been shown that the incorporation of non-canonical subunits can be used to generate hydrolysable lignin by introduction of ester linkages into the polymer and that this type of lignin is more easily removable. Disinapoyl esters (DSEs), which to some degree resemble the monolignol sinapyl alcohol, may be promising lignin modifying units for this purpose. As a first step toward determining whether this goal is achievable, we manipulated metabolic flux in Arabidopsis to increase the amounts of DSEs by overexpressing <em>sinapoylglucose:sinapoylglucose sinapoyltransferase</em> (<em>SST</em>) which produces two main DSEs, 1,2-disinapoylglucose (1,2-DSG) and another compound we identify in this report as 3,4-disinapoyl-fructopyranose.</p>

<p align=""left""><strong>Results</strong></p>

<p align=""left"">We succeeded in overproducing DSEs by introducing an <em>SST-</em>overexpression construct into the<em> sinapoylglucose accumulator1 (sng1-6)</em> mutant (<em>SST</em>-OE <em>sng1-6</em>) which lacks several of the enzymes that would otherwise compete for the SST substrate, sinapoyglucose. Introduction of <em>cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase-c</em> (<em>cad-c</em>) and<em> cad-d</em> mutations into the <em>SST</em>-OE <em>sng1-6</em> line further increased DSEs. Surprisingly, a <em>reduced epidermal fluorescence</em> (<em>ref</em>) phenotype was observed when <em>SST</em>-OE <em>sng1-6</em> plants were evaluated under UV light, which appears to have been induced by the sequestration of DSEs into subvacuolar compartments. Although we successfully upregulated the accumulation of the target DSEs, we did not find any evidence showing the integration of DSEs into the cell wall.</p>

<p align=""left""><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>

<p align=""left"">Our results suggest that although phenylpropanoid metabolic engineering is possible, a deeper understanding of sequestration and transport mechanisms will be necessary for successful lignin engineering through this route.</p>","arabidopsis, biochemistry, biotechnology","Huaping Mo, Clint C S Chapple, Jeong Kim, Shinyoung Lee, Michael Witt"

<p id=""top"">US national wide gSSURGO based floodplain maps are developed by using Gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO) database. Specifically, the SSURGO map units are joined to certain key attributes in the muaggatt and component tables. After joining the spatial data to &lsquo;muaggatt&rsquo; and &lsquo;component&rsquo; tables, map unit polygons are selected by the following two queries: (1) &quot;geomdesc&quot; LIKE &#39;%flood%&#39; AND &quot;comppct_r&quot; &gt;= 85) OR &quot;taxsubgrp&quot; LIKE &#39;%fluv%&#39;; (2) &ldquo;muname&quot; =&#39;Water&#39; OR &quot;flodfreqdcd&quot; in (&#39;Rare&#39;, &#39;Occasional&#39;, &#39;Frequent&#39;, &#39;Very Frequent&#39;)&quot;. The result from this query, which is a polygon feature class or shapefile, is then dissolved to remove any area less than 15000 square meters are removed. More details about this approach can be found in the following publication: Sangwan, Nikhil, and V. Merwade, A faster and economical approach to floodplain mapping by using soil information, Journal of American Water Resources Association, 51(5): 1286-1304.

<p>The US 36/Rockville Road bridge over I-465 was struck by a northbound mobile car crusher during the morning rush hour of January 10, 2017. Indiana State Police and INDOT shut down both the overpass and a section of the interstate to assess the damage and develop an action plan. INDOT engineers determined that 4 of the 14 load-bearing pre-stressed concrete girders were damaged beyond repair and must be removed.</p>

<p>INDOT and contractors mobilized the demolition equipment necessary to remove the damaged bridge sections.&nbsp; I-465 was reopened to traffic at &shy;&shy;around 12:30 p.m. on January 11, just under 29 hours after the incident occurred. One lane of eastbound traffic on Rockville Road was temporarily shifted north across the median to use the undamaged westbound side of the bridge until reconstruction could be completed.</p>

<p>The Rockville Road bridge over I-465 was built in 2009 as part of the Accelerate 465 Corridor project. Each replacement beam measures 125 feet in length and weighs nearly 70 tons. Four total beams were necessary to rebuild the bridge. On February 28, 2017, the beams were delivered to the site and installed that night.</p>","bridge beam placement, bridge construction, civil engineering, construction time-lapse, rockville road, rockville road accident, rockville road bridge crash","Wayne A.

Genomics, in press","<p>Expression of mammalian genes is regulated by many proteins.&nbsp; Examples include proteins that repress transcription, and proteins (<em>i.e.</em> MLL1, MLL2, and CXXC1) that contribute to the formation of chromatin states that support gene activation.&nbsp; The structure of MLL1, MLL2, and CXXC1 includes a domain that binds nonmethylated DNA.&nbsp; DNA sequences that bind MLL1 are known as MLL1 morphemes.&nbsp; Repressors of gene expression include enzymes that methylate DNA (<em>i.e.</em> DNMT3A and DNMT3L), and proteins that associate with specific methylated DNA sequences (<em>i.e.</em> ZFP57).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In mammals, regulation of gene expression also includes a process known as genomic imprinting: a subset of genes is imprinted (by CpG methylation) producing parent-of-origin-specific gene expression.&nbsp; Genomic imprinting requires collective actions of many proteins including TRIM28, ZFP57, DNMT3A and DNMT3L. Since the ZFP57 binding site (ZFBS) occurs frequently along chromosomal DNA, additional sequence features might be required for the selective association of ZFP57 with the Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs) and Germline Differentially Methylated Regions (gDMRs).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have identified a group of composite DNA elements (ZFBS-Morph overlaps) consisting of the ZFP57 binding site overlapping a subset of the MLL1 morphemes.&nbsp; Data evaluations revealed that ZFBS-Morph overlaps significantly reduced chromosomal occurrences of ZFP57 binding site, thus facilitating localization of ICRs/gDMRs in chromosomal DNA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This publication provides a text file that lists the positions of ZFBS and ZFBS-Morph overlaps in the build mm9 of the mouse genome.&nbsp; The file is in a format (.bed) suitable for uploading and creating a custom track at the UCSC genome browser.&nbsp;</p>

Indiana State Police and INDOT shut down both the overpass and a section of the interstate in order to assess the damage and develop an action plan. INDOT engineers determined that 4 of the 14 load-bearing pre-stressed concrete girders were damaged beyond repair and had to be removed.</p>

<p>INDOT and contractors mobilized the demolition equipment necessary to remove the damaged bridge sections. I-465 was reopened to traffic at &shy;&shy;around 12:30 p.m. on January 11, just under 29 hours after the incident occurred. One lane of eastbound traffic on Rockville Road was temporarily shifted north across the median to use the undamaged westbound side of the bridge until reconstruction could be completed.</p>

<p>The Rockville Road bridge over I-465 was built in 2009 as part of the Accelerate 465 Corridor project. Each replacement beam measures 125 feet long and weighs nearly 70 tons. Four total beams were necessary to rebuild the bridge. On February 28, 2017, the beams were delivered to the site and installed that night.</p>

<p>Contractors were on a tight schedule to open the bridge before the Indianapolis 500 race day in May. On May 1, 2017, construction of the bridge was complete and the bridge was reopened to traffic.</p>","bridge beam placement, bridge construction, bridge reconstruction, civil engineering, construction time-lapse, rockville road, rockville road accident, rockville road bridge crash","Wayne A.

<p>Purdue&#39;s campus landscape continues to change with the construction of new buildings and the remodel of old buildings. In 2012 the Engineering Administration Building (ENAD) and the iconic Heat and Power Plant-North (HPN) were targeted for demolition to make way for the construction of the Wilmeth Active Learning Center (WALC); a building with offices, collaborative spaces and classrooms with an emphasis on new instructional models. The Purdue University Lyles School of Civil Engineering capitalized on a key opportunity for education and research. Five cameras were installed to capture images from the demolition of the Engineering Administration Building and the Power Plant, to the construction of the Wilmeth Active Learning Center. The images from 3 fixed cameras situated on the Mathematical Sciences Building (MATH) and the Potter (A. A.) Engineering Center (POTR) can be accessed and used for educational and research purposes.</p>

<p>Representative time lapse videos were created from these three cameras for each month of the project.

<p>Purdue&#39;s campus landscape continues to change with the construction of new buildings and the remodel of old buildings. In 2012 the Engineering Administration Building (ENAD) and the iconic Heat and Power Plant-North (HPN) were targeted for demolition to make way for the construction of the Wilmeth Active Learning Center (WALC); a building with offices, collaborative spaces and classrooms with an emphasis on new instructional models. The Purdue University Lyles School of Civil Engineering capitalized on a key opportunity for education and research. Five cameras were installed to capture images from the demolition of the Engineering Administration Building and the Power Plant, to the construction of the Wilmeth Active Learning Center. The images from 3 fixed cameras situated on the Mathematical Sciences Building (MATH) and the Potter (A. A.) Engineering Center (POTR) can be accessed and used for educational and research purposes.</p>

<p>Representative time lapse videos were created from these three cameras for each month of the project.

<p>A programmable optical stimulator for Drosophila eyes is presented. The target application of the stimulator is to induce retinal degeneration in fly photoreceptor cells by exposing them to light in a controlled manner. The goal of this work is to obtain a reproducible system for studying age-related changes in susceptibility to environmental ocular stress. The stimulator uses light emitting diodes and an embedded computer to control illuminance, color (blue or red) and duration in two independent chambers. Further, the stimulator is equipped with per-chamber light and temperature sensors and a fan to monitor light intensity and to control temperature. An ON/OFF temperature control implemented on the embedded computer keeps the temperature from reaching levels that will induce the heat shock stress response in the flies. A custom enclosure was fabricated to house the electronic components of the stimulator. The enclosure provides a light-impermeable environment that allows air flow and lets users easily load and unload fly vials. Characterization results show that the fabricated stimulator can produce light at illuminances ranging from 0 to 16000 lux and power density levels from 0 to 7.2 mW/cm2 for blue light. For red light the maximum illuminance is 8000 lux which corresponds to a power density of 3.54 mW/cm2. The fans and the ON/OFF temperature control are able to keep the temperature inside the chambers below 28.17 C. Experiments with white-eye male flies were performed to assess the ability of the fabricated simulator to induce blue light-dependent retinal degeneration. Retinal degeneration is observed in flies exposed to 8 hours of blue light at 7949 lux. Flies in a control experiment with no light exposure show no retinal degeneration. Flies exposed to red light for the similar duration and light intensity (8 hours and 7994 lux) do not show retinal degeneration either. Hence, the fabricated stimulator can be used to create environmental ocular stress using blue light.</p>

Features encoded at units are visualized for intuitively understanding the internal...","<p>Real-life&nbsp;visual world is highly&nbsp;diverse&nbsp;and complex, but could be decomposed into a large yet finite number of visual features (LeCun et al., 2015). In general, these features span various levels of abstraction ranging from the low-level (e.g. orientation and color) to the mid-level (e.g. shapes and textures) to the high-level (e.g. objects and actions). So far, deep learning provides the most comprehensive computational models to encode and extract the hierarchical visual features from natural pictures or videos. Importantly, the deep-learning models,&nbsp;as a class of deep artificial neural networks, are built and trained with similar organizational and coding principles as biological neuronal networks in the brain itself. Recent studies demonstrate that such models are well aligned to and predictive of cascaded cortical processes underlying visual perception. For these reasons, deep learning offers a fully observable and computable model of the human visual system and thus it may facilitate the understanding of cortical processes underlying natural vision. As in our study (Wen et al., 2017), the deep residual neural network (ResNet) (He et al., 2016), a specific type of deep neural network, was able to predict the cortical responses to novel natural movie stimuli across nearly the entire visual cortex. To further understand the internal representations in ResNet, we visualized the features encoded at distinct layers as images in pixel space for intuitive interpretation.&nbsp;Briefly, we visualize the feature at a computational unit by&nbsp;optimizing&nbsp;visual inputs that maximize the unit&nbsp;activation, as proposed in (Yosinski et al., 2015). The results were obtained by using the Caffe Deep Learning framework (Jia et al., 2014).&nbsp;</p>","biomedical engineering, deep learning, natural vision, neural encoding, object recognition","Haiguang Wen, Junxing Shi, Zhongming Liu, Wei Chen, Sandi L Caldrone"

The stimulator uses red and blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and an embedded computer to generate light at different power density levels.","<p>A programmable optical stimulator for Drosophila eyes is presented. The target application of the stimulator is to induce retinal degeneration in fly photoreceptor cells by exposing them to light in a controlled manner. The goal of this work is to obtain a reproducible system for studying age-related changes in susceptibility to environmental ocular stress. The stimulator uses light emitting diodes and an embedded computer to control illuminance, color (blue or red) and duration in two independent chambers. Further, the stimulator is equipped with per-chamber light and temperature sensors and a fan to monitor light intensity and to control temperature. An ON/OFF temperature control implemented on the embedded computer keeps the temperature from reaching levels that will induce the heat shock stress response in the flies. A custom enclosure was fabricated to house the electronic components of the stimulator. The enclosure provides a light-impermeable environment that allows air flow and lets users easily load and unload fly vials. Characterization results show that the fabricated stimulator can produce light at illuminances ranging from 0 to 16000 lux and power density levels from 0 to 7.2 mW/cm2 for blue light. For red light the maximum illuminance is 8000 lux which corresponds to a power density of 3.54 mW/cm2. The fans and the ON/OFF temperature control are able to keep the temperature inside the chambers below 28.17 C. Experiments with white-eye male flies were performed to assess the ability of the fabricated simulator to induce blue light-dependent retinal degeneration. Retinal degeneration is observed in flies exposed to 8 hours of blue light at 7949 lux. Flies in a control experiment with no light exposure show no retinal degeneration. Flies exposed to red light for the similar duration and light intensity (8 hours and 7994 lux) do not show retinal degeneration either. Hence, the fabricated stimulator can be used to create environmental ocular stress using blue light.</p>","biomedical engineering, drosophila, embedded software, embedded system, engineering technology, optical stimulation, python code","Donald Ready, Taylor Zigon, Vikki Weake, Walter Leon-Salas, Xinping Chen, Sandi L Caldrone"

<p>Purdue&#39;s campus landscape continues to change with the construction of new buildings and the remodel of old buildings. In 2012 the Engineering Administration Building (ENAD) and the iconic Heat and Power Plant-North (HPN) were targeted for demolition to make way for the construction of the Wilmeth Active Learning Center (WALC); a building with offices, collaborative spaces and classrooms with an emphasis on new instructional models. The Purdue University Lyles School of Civil Engineering capitalized on a key opportunity for education and research. Five cameras were installed to capture images from the demolition of the Engineering Administration Building and the Power Plant, to the construction of the Wilmeth Active Learning Center. The images from 3 fixed cameras situated on the Mathematical Sciences Building (MATH) and the Potter (A. A.) Engineering Center (POTR) can be accessed and used for educational and research purposes.</p>

<p>Representative time lapse videos were created from these three cameras for each month of the project.

<p>&ldquo;Painting and the Question of Concepts&rdquo; was an 8-lecture seminar given from late March to early June of 1981. In this seminar, Deleuze critiques aesthetic theories which treat art as &lsquo;representation&rsquo;, presenting instead his own aesthetic concepts. Many of the concepts and works of art discussed herein also appear in Deleuze&rsquo;s book published the same year,<em> Francis Bacon-Logique de la sensation</em> (<em>Francis Bacon: The Logic of Sensation</em>), making &ldquo;Painting and the Question of Concepts&rdquo; an important companion to Deleuze&rsquo;s book.</p>

<p>In the 26 May 1981 lecture, Deleuze reviews the central theme of the seminar: a consideration of painting as the act by which one transmits or reproduces a space-signal on the canvas, either by analogy or modulation. Topics of discussion include: the evolving conception of art from the Egyptians to the Greeks, whence philosophy; the primacy of the foreground; the Greek <em>organon</em>; the tactical-optical space of the Greeks, and the passage from tactile-optical space to a pure optical space; the &lsquo;collective line&rsquo;; the problems of the color(s) of the body/ flesh and of the earth, especially in the West; Goethe; Heinrich W&ouml;lfflin; the Stoics; Plotinus and light; Raphael; C&eacute;zanne; modulation of light; French painter Paul Signac; Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix; and the four &lsquo;characters&rsquo; (<em>caract&egrave;res</em>) of color.</p>

Recent modeling work suggests that the oxidation of polyolefinic &gamma;-terpinene can be the dominant source of nighttime ON in a mixed forest environment. However, the ON yields, aerosol partitioning behavior, and SOA yields from &gamma;-terpinene oxidation by the nitrate radical (NO<sub>3</sub>), an important nighttime oxidant, have not been determined experimentally. In this work, we present a comprehensive experimental investigation of the total (gas + particle) ON, hydroxy nitrate, and SOA yields following &gamma;-terpinene oxidation by NO<sub>3</sub>. Under dry conditions, the hydroxy nitrate yield = 4(+1/&minus;3)&thinsp;%, total ON yield = 14(+3/&minus;2)&thinsp;%, and SOA yield &le;10% under atmospherically-relevant particle mass loadings, similar to those for &alpha;-pinene + NO<sub>3</sub>. Using a chemical box model, we show that the measured concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;and &gamma;-terpinene hydroxy nitrates can be reliably simulated from &alpha;-pinene + NO<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;chemistry. This suggests that NO<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;addition to either of the two internal double bonds of &gamma;-terpinene primarily decomposes forming a relatively volatile keto&ndash;aldehyde, reconciling the small SOA yield observed here and for other internal olefinic terpenes. Based on aerosol partitioning analysis and identification of speciated particle-phase ON applying high-resolution liquid chromatography&ndash;mass spectrometry, we estimate that a significant fraction of the particle-phase ON has the hydroxy nitrate moiety. This work greatly contributes to our understanding of ON and SOA formation from polyolefin monoterpene oxidation, which could be important in the northern continental U.S. and Midwest, where polyolefinic monoterpene emissions are greatest.</p>

<p>In the 25 March 1986 lecture, topics of discussion include: the forces composing humans; the infinite and classical thought; the mechanism of unfolding (<em>d&eacute;pli</em>) or deployment (<em>d&eacute;ploiement</em>); the folding (<em>r&eacute;pli</em>) of the forces of finitude, life, work, and language in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; the dispersion of language as a correlate of the form &#39;Man&#39; in Foucault&#39;s <em>The Order of Things</em>; the gathering (<em>rassemblement</em>) of language in modern literature; the being of language as different from linguistics; language, linguistics, literature and life; the nineteenth century and the historicity of life as dependent on the environment (<em>milieu</em>); Cuvier and the diachronicity of language; knowledge (<em>le savoir</em>), the language of the outside, and the language of life; madness; Nietzsche, the concept of the <em>&Uuml;bermensch</em>, and the last men; the decoupling (<em>d&eacute;crochage</em>) of literature&nbsp; from linguistics, and of biology from the raw (<em>brut</em>) being of life; genetic codes; molecular biology, carbon and silicon; agrammaticality; the forces in humans and the forces of the finite-unlimited; and the superfold (<em>surpli</em>) as a folding on the outside.</p>

<p>&quot;Foucault&quot; was a 25-lecture seminar given from October 1985 to May 1986. In these lectures, Deleuze offers his interpretation and analysis of French philosopher Michel Foucault&#39;s work. Examining the theoretical foundations and major themes of Foucault&#39;s philosophy, Deleuze dedicates several lectures to each of what he calls the &quot;three axes&quot; of Foucault&#39;s thought. This seminar coincides with the publication of Deleuze&#39;s book <em>Foucault</em> (1986).</p>

<p>In the 08 April 1986 lecture, topics of discussion include: Foucault and the three forms of God, Man and Superman; humans and machines; the orders of infinity in the seventeenth century; the &#39;center of man&#39; in the seventeenth century; Christ; Pascal; forces of the outside (<em>dehors</em>) and forces in humans; the Hegelian dialectic (reconciliation of the finite self with the infinite) and the Platonic dialectic; the principle of non-contradiction in Hegel (A is not not-A = the negation of negation); the negative as a force of thought, and the principle of non-contradiction in relation to the principle of identity; that the negative is not limitation, but rather a force; negative numbers; Foucault&#39;s <em>The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: The Will to Knowledge</em>, and <em>Discipline and Punish</em>; the rise of biopolitics of populations, and the rise of the discipline of bodies; race in fascism; Nietzsche and the promise; the contract and the maximum in relation to goods (<em>de biens</em>); the right of the person; the power of control; how the law manages open multiplicities, whose limitations are not assignable, treatable only by the calculation and control of probabilities and social meaning (<em>sens</em>); population management and zones of frequency; why for Foucault the prison ceased to be an effective form of punishment; the organization of work time; Paul Virilio; roadways and control; the maritime hospital in the nineteenth century; exile and the visual grid (<em>le quadrillage</em>); the subject of law as &#39;the living&#39; (<em>le vivant</em>) in humans, and no longer God or the personhood in humans; contracts and society as a third party; the transition from civil law to social law; two conceptions of law: the contractual relationship and the social law; the patient, the doctor and social security; &#39;the living&#39; in humans in the name of quality of life; life in humans as the problem of law today; the epoch that abolishes the death penalty (foundational in the social law of sovereignty) yet produces the greatest genocide by getting rid of (<em>se debarrasser</em>) an infectious agent; German Jewish philosopher and writer Walter Benjamin, and the link between demonstrations by the masses and fascism; the status of images relative to law and the subject in the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries, respectively; and the French historian and philosopher Fran&ccedil;ois Ewald.</p>

<p>Deleuze also discusses how the three formations of sovereignty, discipline, and biopolitics produce three very different subjects of the law, respectively.&nbsp; In the case of sovereignty, it has the power to levy, to take from people, and to decide on their death. In the case of discipline, it has the power to impose tasks on a small number of human multiplicities, taken within assignable limits, and to impose environments of confinement. The power of discipline is no longer the power to levy, but rather to compose forces that are useful to society. Hence, the legal constitution (<em>la constitution juridique</em>) of humans is no longer the relationship of people to the sovereign, but of human to human. In the case of biopolitics, Deleuze argues that it appears when the law begins to manage life. In contrast to discipline, biopolitics can operate on any number of open multiplicities.</p>

<p>Note: a) The volume for a small portion of the lecture during which a student is asking a question is very low, and at times effectively inaudible.

<p>Dans la conf&eacute;rence du 8 avril 1986, les sujets de discussion comprennent: Foucault et les trois formes de Dieu, Homme et Surhomme; les forces dans les humains; les humains et les machines; les ordres de l&#39;infini au XVIIe si&egrave;cle; le centre de l&#39;homme au XVIIe si&egrave;cle; Christ; Pascal; les forces du dehors et forces dans les humains; la dialectique h&eacute;g&eacute;lienne (r&eacute;conciliation du moi fini avec l&#39;infini) et la dialectique platonicienne; le principe de non-contradiction dans Hegel (A n&#39;est pas non-A = la n&eacute;gation de la n&eacute;gation); le n&eacute;gatif comme force de pens&eacute;e et le principe de non-contradiction par rapport au principe d&#39;identit&eacute;; que le n&eacute;gatif n&#39;est pas une limitation, mais plut&ocirc;t une force; les nombres n&eacute;gatifs; <em>La volont&eacute; de savoir</em> et <em>Surveiller et punir</em> de Foucault; l&#39;essor de la biopolitique des populations et l&rsquo;essor de la discipline des corps; de la race dans le fascisme; Nietzsche et la promesse; le contrat et le maximum de biens; le droit de la personne; le pouvoir du contr&ocirc;le; comment le droit se propose de g&egrave;rer les multiplicit&eacute;s ouvertes, dont les limites ne sont pas assignables, traitables seulement par le calcul et le contr&ocirc;le des probabilit&eacute;s et du sens social; gestion de la population et zones de fr&eacute;quence; pourquoi pour Foucault la prison a cess&eacute; d&#39;&ecirc;tre une forme efficace de punition; l&#39;am&eacute;nagement du temps de travail; Paul Virilio; voiries et contr&ocirc;le; l&#39;h&ocirc;pital maritime au XIXe si&egrave;cle; l&#39;exil et le quadrillage; le sujet de droit comme &laquo;le vivant&raquo; dans les humains, et non plus le Dieu ou la personne dans les humains; les contrats et la soci&eacute;t&eacute; comme un tierce partie; la passage du droit civil au droit social; les deux conceptions du droit: la relation contractuelle et le droit social; le malade, le m&eacute;decin et la s&eacute;curit&eacute; sociale; &laquo;le vivant&raquo; dans les humains au nom d&rsquo;une qualit&eacute; de vie; la vie dans les humains comme le probl&egrave;me du droit aujourd&#39;hui; l&#39;&eacute;poque qui abolit la peine de mort (fondement du droit social de la souverainet&eacute;) mais produit le plus grand g&eacute;nocide en se d&eacute;barrassant de l&rsquo;agent infectieux; le philosophe et &eacute;crivain juif allemand Walter Benjamin, et le li&eacute;e entre les grandes d&eacute;monstrations de masses et le fascisme; le statut des images relatives au droit et au sujet respectivement aux XVIIIe, XIXe et XXe si&egrave;cles; et l&#39;historien et philosophe fran&ccedil;ais Fran&ccedil;ois Ewald.</p>

<p>Deleuze explique aussi comment les trois formations de la souverainet&eacute;, de la discipline et de la biopolitique produisent respectivement trois sujets tr&egrave;s diff&eacute;rents du droit. Dans le cas de la souverainet&eacute;, il a le pouvoir de pr&eacute;lever, de prendre des personnes et de d&eacute;cider de leur mort. Dans le cas de la discipline, elle a le pouvoir d&#39;imposer des t&acirc;ches &agrave; un petit nombre de multiplicit&eacute;s humaines, prises dans des limites assignables, et d&#39;imposer des grands milieux d&rsquo;enfermements. Le pouvoir de la discipline n&#39;est plus le pouvoir de pr&eacute;lever, mais plut&ocirc;t de composer des forces utiles &agrave; la soci&eacute;t&eacute;. Ainsi, la constitution juridique de la forme des humains n&#39;est plus le rapport des gens au souverain, mais de l&#39;humain &agrave; l&#39;humain. Dans le cas de la biopolitique, Deleuze fait valoir qu&#39;il appara&icirc;t lorsque le droit commence &agrave; g&eacute;rer la vie.

This seminar coincides with the publication of Deleuze&#39;s book <em>Foucault</em> (1986).</p>

<p>The early portion of the 20 May 1986 lecture features Eric Alliez discussing&nbsp;social struggles in Italy and Italian Marxism. Topics of discussion from Deleuze&#39;s lecture include: the three historical ontologies according to Foucault: knowledge (le savoir), power and the self; Nicholas of Cusa, his treatise <em>De Possest</em>, being-force (<em>l&#39;&ecirc;tre-puissance</em>) and being-power (<em>l&#39;&ecirc;tre-pouvoir</em>); Foucault as a historian of conditions, knowledge, power and subjectivities; revisiting what &quot;to think&quot; (<em>penser</em>) means in Foucault; singularities, thought, chance and the relation of forces; play (<em>le jeu</em>); the relations of frequencies (AZERT); Nietzsche and Mallarm&eacute;; Heraclitus; Leibniz; that to think is to fold, and the thought of being-self (<em>l&#39;etre-soi</em>) as constitutive; the inside (<em>le dedans</em>) of the outside (<em>le dehors</em>); the topology of thought; making a diagram of Foucault&#39;s thought; the &ldquo;to see-to speak&rdquo; (le voir-le parler) disjunction; strata, and the search for the non-stratified; life in the archive; non-stratified elements (e.g., the aerial, the oceanic, the zone of partial deaths or the zone of relations of forces as a relation between singular points, the zone of being-power); the line of the outside and singularities; Melville&#39;s novel&nbsp; <em>Moby-Dick</em>, and the velocity (<em>vitesse</em>) of the lines of the outside; Belgian-born French artist and writer Henri Michaux, his experience with mescaline as captured in his novel <em>Miserable Miracle</em>, and his book <em>Les Grandes &Eacute;preuves de l&#39;esprit</em>; the accelerated linear, the line of high velocity, molecular velocity, and the line of thought; velocity ​​and thought; that to think is to confront (<em>affronter</em>) the velocity of thought, and how to survive this; Spinoza&#39;s <em>Ethics</em>, Books IV and V; subjectivation; French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty&#39;s book <em>The Visible and the Invisible</em>, the &quot;to see&quot; and subjectivation, and painters; possible treatments of the lines of the outside; the stakes (<em>mise en jeu</em>) of linear systems; how to co-live (<em>co-vivre</em>) with, rather than survive until, death; the fold and the topology of subjectivity; Foucault, linguistics and literature, and the privilege of the statement; and time, Foucault&rsquo;s <em>The Order of Things</em>, and the affection of thought by itself.</p>

<p>This dataset includes: four mp3 recordings of the lecture (total time, 2:45:49), an aggregate version of the audio recordings into a single mp3, and the complete French transcription of the recorded lecture in both pdf (24 pp) and plain text.</p>

<p>Note: Eric Alliez&rsquo;s commentary runs from (approx.) the 2:50-35:57&nbsp;marks of both the part 1 and the complete audio files. The volume for this portion of the recordings is very low, and at times Alliez is effectively inaudible.&nbsp;Alliez&rsquo;s commentary has not been transcribed here.</p>

While controlling deck cracking or decreasing the permeability and porosity of concrete can improve performance and service life, chloride and moisture ingress as well as cracking cannot be eliminated. Full-depth cracks which are caused by restrained shrinkage allow for corrosive conditions at early ages for both the top and bottom reinforcement mats. Therefore, the use of corrosion-resistant reinforcement is essential to mitigate deterioration of bridge decks.</p>

<p>The objective of this research program is to evaluate both the structural and corrosion performance of concrete bridge decks reinforced with corrosion-resistant reinforcement. To achieve this objective, a three phase experimental investigation was conducted considering a wide range of corrosion-resistant reinforcing materials. These materials included stainless steel (316LN, Duplex 2205, Duplex 2304, and XM-28), MMFX II microcomposite steel, and coated steel (epoxy, hot-dip galvanized, zinc-clad, and dual-coated zinc and epoxy (Zbar)). Forty-five beam specimens with tension lap splices were tested in the first phase to evaluate the bond between corrosion-resistant reinforcement and concrete. The test data were combined with other data available in literature to construct a simple model for development and splice length considering the range of corrosion resistant bar types as well as unconfined and confined conditions. Twelve slab specimens were tested in the second phase to evaluate the cracking behavior of slabs reinforced with corrosion-resistant reinforcement.</p>

<p>Finally, one hundred twelve modified macrocells were constructed in the third phase to evaluate corrosion resistance under uncracked and cracked conditions. Transverse steel was also tied to the longitudinal steel to simulate actual bridge deck conditions. Based on the results of this study, a simple model is recommended for the calculation of development and splice lengths for both conventional black and corrosion-resistant reinforcing steel with and without confinement. Test results indicate that stainless steel, MMFX II, galvanized, and dual-coated bars have bond strengths comparable with black bars. Modification factors were developed for development and splice length calculations when other bar types are used. Recommendations are also provided for the control of crack widths. Considering corrosion resistance, identical reinforcing materials should be used in the top and bottom reinforcing mats while inert ties or ties made of the same material as the reinforcing bars should be used to avoid galvanic coupling. Finally, to assist in the selection of corrosion-resistant reinforcement, a ranking of the corrosion performance of various corrosion-resistant bars is provided based on test results and a visual examination after 503 days of exposure.</p>","bridge deck, civil engineering, corrosion-resistant reinforcing bar, datacenterhub, reinforced concrete, stainless steal, structural engineering","Chungwook Sim, Robert J.

Deluga's disertation","<p>Shear strength of reinforced concrete beams without web reinforcement has been reported to decrease with increases in depth. This is often referred to as a size effect. This reduction in shear strength has been reported to decrease with the use of web reinforcement and increases in maximum aggregate size. The purpose of this study was to test two hypotheses 1) shear strength increases with increases in maximum aggregate size and 2) aggregate gradation affects this increase in shear strength. Maximum aggregate size is defined here as the size of the smallest sieve opening through which all aggregate particles pass. The proposed hypotheses were tested against results from ten simply-supported 12 in. deep beams, two simply-supported 48 in. deep beams and previous test results (Taylor 1972, Chana 1981, Murray 2010, McCain 2012). All beams tested in this study had the same length, effective depth, width, concrete cover, and longitudinal reinforcement size and spacing. The variables controlled in the experiments and described in this report were maximum aggregate size and gradation. Maximum aggregate size varied from 3/8 to 1 in.</p>

<p>A database was compiled using results presented here and previous results (Taylor 1972, Chana 1981, Murray 2010, McCain 2012) to evaluate the proposed hypotheses. The test results studied supported the first hypothesis. In two out of two groups of tests of comparable beams in which the only nominal difference was maximum aggregate size, an increase in maximum aggregate size led to an increase in shear strength. The second hypothesis was not supported by the test results studied . For the same maximum aggregate size, the unit shear strength was not observed to change with in the range of tested aggregate gradations.</p>","aggregate interlock, civil engineering, datacenterhub, maximum aggregate size, purdue university, reinforced concrete, shear strength, size effect, structural engineering","Derek R.

The flexural strength of these columns is controlled by the strength of the steel. It follows that two sections with different grades of steel have similar moment capacities as long as the product of reinforcement ratio and yield stress is similar for both sections. Experimental tests of this hypothesis are presented. Tests of columns reinforced with steels having yield stresses ranging from 60-ksi to 120-ksi were conducted.

Additionally, four of the small beams were cast using aggregate that had not been scaled to study the influence of aggregate size on the unit shear strength of beams of equal size. The specimens, each having a shear span to effective depth ratio of 2.3, were tested to failure under a concentrated load at midspan. The experimental results indicated that when all beam components were geometrically scaled in proportion to depth, beams of different sizes developed similar unit shear strengths, within 20% of one another. The ratio of aggregate size to beam size influenced unit shear strength to the extent that 12-in. deep beams containing 1-in. maximum aggregate size exhibited a unit shear strength that was 35% greater than the unit strength of specimens containing 1/2-in. aggregate.</p>","aggregate interlock, civil engineering, datacenterhub, reinforced concrete, reinforced concrete large beams, scaling effects, shear strength, size effect, structural engineering","Matthew Murray, Santiago Pujol, Stanislav Pejša"

But the provisions often require splices to be longer than 40 bar diameters. Recent structural failures have indicated the vulnerability of lap splices with length-to-bar-diameter ratios equal to or exceeding 40. In this study, the tensile strength of unconfined deformed-bar lap splices with different lengths is reexamined. The focus is on lap splices with length-to-bar-diameter ratios of 40 or more. The tensile strength of lap splices in configurations resembling those observed to have splice failures in the field is also examined.</p>

<p>Three series of tests (with a total of forty-five specimens) were conducted on specimens with lap lengths varying from 20 to 85 bar diameters. In series one, twenty-seven prismatic coupons were tested monotonically to failure in tension. In the second and third series, a total of eighteen beams were tested to failure. The beam lap splices were located in a region of constant moment.</p>

<p>The results in this study indicated that increasing the length of a lap splice beyond 45 bar diameters was an inefficient way to increase the strength of the splice. The results also indicated that a mean unit bond strength of 5&radic;f&#39;c (in psi) is not a lower bound, as suggested by current design provisions, to the strength of unconfined deformed-bar lap splices with a minimum clear cover of 1 bar diameter and a minimum clear spacing between bars of 2 bar diameters.</p>

<p>To address these issues, a new perspective on the tensile strength of unconfined lap splices is explored. It is suggested that, rather than setting a lower bound to the mean unit bond strength for design, an upper bound of 900&radic;f&#39;c (in psi) should be set for the maximum steel stress that can be developed in unconfined deformed-bar lap splices</p>","bond, bond strength, civil engineering, coupon, datacenterhub, deformed bar, development length, lap splice, reinforced concrete, splice lenght, structural concrete, structural engineering","Brian Richter, Santiago Pujol, Stanislav Pejša"

Here, in large part through the philosophy of Henri Bergson, Deleuze rethinks film as a movement-image, as opposed to a succession of still frames or photographic images. Throughout the course he references a wide variety of filmmakers, critics, and philosophers.

<p>In the 10 November 1981 lecture, Deleuze introduces the seminar and his definition of the movement-image. Topics of consideration during this seminar will include: the work of French philosopher Henri Bergson, particularly his <em>Matter and Memory</em>; Bergson&#39;s three theses of movement; cinema and cinematography; and the relationship between image and thought. Further topics of discussion in this first lecture include: Bergson&#39;s <em>Creative Evolution</em> (Ch. 4); the English mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead; movement and privileged positions of phenomena; the extremal point or acme of Greek tragedy; the reconstitution of movement through the dialectic of poses (or forms); the sequence of poses; the beginnings of modern science; and cinema and movement.</p>

As a precursor to the publication of Deleuze&rsquo;s first of two volumes on cinema, <em>Cinema 1: The Movement-Image</em>&nbsp;(<em>Cin&eacute;ma 1. L&#39;Image-Mouvement</em>, 1983), this seminar is a valuable resource to researchers interested in Deleuze&rsquo;s film theory, as well as his larger philosophical oeuvre.</p>

<p>In the 02 March 1982 lecture, topics of discussion include: the affection-image; close-ups, the face and affects; the French film director Jacques Tourneur; Expressionism (film); British film director Terence Fisher&#39;s <em>Dracula</em>; the Gothic image; English film director James Whale&rsquo;s <em>Frankenstein</em>; the affect as a singular essence, or the power-quality, expressed in a face; the exposure for itself of the power-quality; the French filmmaker Pascal Auger; the potentiation of space; F.W. Murnau; American-born German film director Arthur Robison and his <em>Warning Shadows</em> (<em>Schatten - Eine n&auml;chtliche Halluzination</em>); the color-image and surface colors; French-Swiss film director and critic Jean-Luc Godard, his <em>Contempt</em> (<em>Le M&eacute;pris</em>) and atmospherics; Antonioni&#39;s <em>Red Desert</em> (<em>Il deserto rosso</em>); the Belgian-born film director Agn&egrave;s Varda; the direct constitution of any space, and empty spaces; the city ​​images of German film director Rainer Werner Fassbinder; Swiss film director Daniel Schmid and his <em>Shadow of Angels</em> (<em>Schatten der Engel</em>); Wim Wenders; the affect of fear; French film critic and historian Jean Narboni on the hollow spaces of French filmmaker Jean-Marie Straub; and French film director Alain Resnais and his <em>Muriel</em>.</p>

<p>This dataset includes: two mp3 recordings of the lecture (total time, 2:20:57), an aggregate version of the audio recordings into a single mp3, and the complete French transcription of the recorded lecture in both pdf (30 pp) and plain text.</p>

<p>Note: The first 45 seconds of the audio file for part 1 has been deleted as it contained mostly ambient sound. In that portion of the file, Deleuze could barely be heard speaking with students, but the conversation could not be made out well due to the quality of the audio file.</p>

Other topics of discussion include: French philosopher and physician Georges Canguilhem and his <em>Knowledge of Life</em> (<em>La Connaissance de la vie</em>); the milieu; encyclopedias; new concepts in Enlightenment (eighteenth century) science; remote action (<em>l&#39;action &agrave; distance</em>); the English scientist and natural philosopher Isaac Newton; the intermediary between two bodies; S-A-S&#39; as ethics, the vital breath (<em>le souffle vital</em>) and aesthetics; the line of the universe, vector space, the disappearing of things and the search for the frame; French mathematical philosopher and escaped prisoner of war Albert Lautman; the concept of existence in mathematics; the local and the global; and German mathematician Bernhard Riemann, spaces, and events.</p>

<p>On February 06, 2016, a magnitude 6.7 earthquake occurred in Meinong, Taiwan. Most of the damage to life and infrastructure concentrated in and around Tainan City located in the South Western part of Taiwan.</p>

<p>A team of engineers, faculty and graduate researchers from Purdue University, USA, National Centre for Research on Earthquake Engineering (NCREE), Taiwan, and The American Concrete Institute (ACI), USA investigated the effects of the M6.7 2016 Taiwan (Meinong) Earthquake on reinforced concrete structures. Detailed surveys and inspections of reinforced concrete structures in and around Tainan City were conducted in a reconnaissance effort funded by The National Science Foundation.</p>

<p>The effort was concentrated on identification of buildings with structures similar to new and older reinforced concrete buildings in seismic areas in the U.S. The reconnaissance group consisted of 7 teams (A, B, C, D, E, F and G) with 2 or 3 people in each team. A total of 135 reinforced concrete structures (124 low-rise structures ranging from 1- 7 stories and 11 high-rise structures with up to 23 stories) were surveyed in and around Tainan City.&nbsp; Data including GPS coordinates, hand sketches of floor plans, dimensions of structural and non-structural elements, damage level, photographs, and structural and architectural drawings (if available) were collected and are presented in this dataset.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Movement-Image: Bergsonian Lessons on Cinema&rdquo; was a 21-lecture seminar given from November 1981 to June 1982. This seminar marks the first of four consecutive seminars in which Deleuze presents his theory of film. Here, in large part through the philosophy of Henri Bergson, Deleuze rethinks film as a movement-image, as opposed to a succession of still frames or photographic images. Throughout the course he references a wide variety of filmmakers, critics, and philosophers. As a precursor to the publication of Deleuze&rsquo;s first of two volumes on cinema, <em>Cinema 1: The Movement-Image</em>&nbsp;(<em>Cin&eacute;ma 1.

<p>In the 24 November 1981 lecture, topics of discussion include: Bergson and duration; the movement-image; French filmmaker and writer Jean Epstein and the temporal perspective; natural perception; German film director F.W. Murnau and his film <em>Der letzte Mann </em>(translated in English as <em>The Last Laugh</em>); Soviet film director and theorist Sergei Eisenstein and the montage; the dialectic between pathetic and organic movement; French film director and actor Abel Gance and the montage; the intensive factor of movement and light; and framing, temporal perspective and montage.</p>

Ici, en grande partie gr&acirc;ce &agrave; la philosophie d&#39;Henri Bergson, Deleuze repense le film comme un image-mouvement, par opposition &agrave; une succession d&#39;images fixes ou d&#39;images photographiques. Tout au long du cours, il fait r&eacute;f&eacute;rence &agrave; une grande vari&eacute;t&eacute; des cin&eacute;astes, des critiques et des philosophes. En tant que pr&eacute;curseur de la publication des premiers volumes de Deleuze sur le cin&eacute;ma, <em>Cin&eacute;ma 1. L&#39;Image-Mouvement </em>(1983), ce s&eacute;minaire est une ressource pr&eacute;cieuse pour les chercheurs int&eacute;ress&eacute;s par la th&eacute;orie du film de Deleuze, ainsi que sa plus grande &oelig;uvre philosophique.</p>

<p>Dans la conf&eacute;rence du 19 janvier 1982, Deleuze analyse les trois niveaux de l&#39;image-perception, sp&eacute;cifiquement: le 2&egrave; niveau, avec consideration de Bergson et des deux syst&egrave;mes de perception de la <em>Mati&egrave;re et m&eacute;moire</em> (premier chapitre); et le 3&egrave; niveau, avec consideration de la d&eacute;finition g&eacute;n&eacute;tique de l&#39;image-perception et de ses deux p&ocirc;les.

<p>&ldquo;Cinema, Truth, and Time: The Falsifier&rdquo; was a 22-lecture seminar given from November 1983 to June 1984. This seminar, the third of four consecutive seminars Deleuze gave on cinema, shifts focus from the movement-image to the time-image. In these lectures, Deleuze continues to elaborate his theory of cinema through various theoretical and aesthetic frames including: Ancient Greek philosophy; Nietzsche&rsquo;s reconsideration of the concept of truth; principles of formal logic; literature; the time-image as crystallization; and the filmmakers he thinks are particularly influential in creating the time-image. As a precursor to the publication of Deleuze&rsquo;s second of two volumes on cinema, <em>Cinema 2: The Time-Image</em> (<em>Cin&eacute;ma II. L&#39;image-temps</em>, 1985), this seminar is a valuable resource to researchers interested in Deleuze&rsquo;s film theory, as well as his larger philosophical oeuvre.</p>

<p>In the 17 April 1984 lecture, Deleuze explores how the freeing (<em>le d&eacute;gagement</em>) of a time-image occurs. Topics of discussion include: Kant; time; the time-image; time and succession; intensive and extensive movement; ordinary time; Kant, original time (<em>le temps originaire</em>), and the time of everyday banality (<em>la banalit&eacute; quotidienne</em>); that the &#39;Me&#39; (<em>Moi</em>) and the &#39;I&#39; (<em>Je</em>) are separated by the pure form of time, or the fissure (<em>f&ecirc;lure</em>) of the <em>cogito</em>; the &quot;I am an other&quot; (<em>je est un autre</em>) of Rimbaud; and the Cartesian <em>cogito</em>.</p>

<p>This dataset includes: three mp3 recordings of the lecture (total time, 2:09:28), an aggregate version of the audio recordings into a single mp3, and the complete French transcription of the recorded lecture in both pdf (22 pp) and plain text.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spinoza: The Velocities of Thought&rdquo; was a 14-lecture seminar given from December 1980 to March 1981. In this seminar, Deleuze revisits his examination of Baruch Spinoza&rsquo;s philosophy. Deleuze had previously published two books on Spinoza: <em>Expressionism in Philosophy: Spinoza</em> (<em>Spinoza et le probl&egrave;me de l&#39;expression</em>, 1968), and <em>Spinoza: Practical Philosophy</em> (<em>Spinoza </em>&ndash; <em>Philosophie pratique</em>, 1970, 2nd ed. 1981). The majority of these lectures were given the same year as the publication of the second edition of the latter title.</p>

<p>This portion of the 31 March 1981 lecture marks the end of the Spinoza seminar, and the beginning of the <em>Painting and the Question of Concepts</em> seminar. During the first part of the lecture, Deleuze offers a summary of the Spinoza seminar, fielding questions from students.&nbsp; Other topics of discussion include: states of certainty and the third kind of knowledge; power and consciousness; <em>Ethics</em>, Book V, and happiness; joy and sadness; the encounters of bodies; geometric ideas and common notions; the opportune moment; common notions of bodies; and the game.</p>

<p>Accurate and&nbsp;safe measurement of actual pay items placed is a critical step in the timely&nbsp;completion of&nbsp;a construction project. Currently&nbsp;this is an entirely manual process, with substantial&nbsp;risk to personnel as well as for human error. Thus, the ability to remove personnel from this&nbsp;hazardous&nbsp;environment and to reduce the chance for error is&nbsp;desirable.&nbsp;Image-based&nbsp;technology offers an opportunity to do both.</p>

<p>The Pay Item Measurement (PIM) tool package is provided as two&nbsp;complementary tools&mdash;the Orthophoto Generation Tool and the Graphical&nbsp;Measurement Tool&mdash;and was&nbsp;developed in close cooperation with&nbsp;field engineers from INDOT. PIM is specifically designed to&nbsp;incorporate the typical actions that field personnel follow and enable a safer and reliable approach to construction pay item measurements.&nbsp;Written instructions on aerial image collection are included in Chapters 5.1 and 5.5.2 of the technical report <em>Image-Based Collection and Measurements for Construction Pay Items,</em> available for download at <a href=""https://doi.org/10.5703/1288284316510"">https://doi.org/10.5703/1288284316510</a>.</p>

<p>PIM is intended to&nbsp;generate orthophotos for measurements on a planar surface and take measurements of pay items from that orthophoto.&nbsp;This instructional&nbsp;video provides general image collection guidelines for aerial photographs that yield high-quality orthophotos and an&nbsp;accurate measurement. Guidelines here include an&nbsp;explanation of the process of how to collect suitable high-quality aerial images, which is a&nbsp;critical step for successful orthophoto construction.&nbsp;Several examples are included in the technical report <em>Image-Based Collection and Measurements for Construction Pay Items</em> that demonstrate the characteristics of high-quality image sets that will be successful, as well as image sets that will not.&nbsp;This customized PIM tool&nbsp;package will be most useful, and accurate, when the user guidelines are&nbsp;followed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More information on how to generate the resulting orthophoto and use it for graphical measurements are available in two companion video publications, <em>PIM Tool Instructional Video: Getting Started with the Orthophoto Tool</em>&nbsp;(<a href=""https://doi.org/10.4231/R7TT4P4Z"">https://doi.org/10.4231/R7TT4P4Z</a>)&nbsp;and <em>PIM Tool Instructional Video: Getting Started with the Graphical Measurement Tool</em>&nbsp;(<a href=""https://doi.org/10.4231/R7ZK5DV8"">https://doi.org/10.4231/R7ZK5DV8</a>).</p>","civil engineering, construction, image processing, pay items","Ali Lenjani, Chul Min Yeum, Shirley J.

<p>Purdue&#39;s campus landscape continues to change with the construction of new buildings and the remodel of old buildings. In 2012 the Engineering Administration Building (ENAD) and the iconic Heat and Power Plant-North (HPN) were targeted for demolition to make way for the construction of the Wilmeth Active Learning Center (WALC); a building with offices, collaborative spaces and classrooms with an emphasis on new instructional models. The Purdue University Lyles School of Civil Engineering capitalized on a key opportunity for education and research. Five cameras were installed to capture images from the demolition of the Engineering Administration Building and the Power Plant, to the construction of the Wilmeth Active Learning Center. The images from 3 fixed cameras situated on the Mathematical Sciences Building (MATH) and the Potter (A. A.) Engineering Center (POTR) can be accessed and used for educational and research purposes.</p>

<p>Representative time lapse videos were created from these three cameras for each month of the project. The time lapse videos created from these images - 08:00 to 18:00, 7 days a week in each month - are accessible here: <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.4231/R70P0WXD"">http://dx.doi.org/10.4231/R70P0WXD</a>.</p>","active learning center construction, alc construction, building construction, civil engineering, enadalc, purdue university, walc, wilmeth active learning center","Darcy M.

We find that competition narrows and shifts the range over which proteins can be activated.","<p>A number of neurological disorders arise from perturbations in biochemical signaling and protein complex formation within neurons. Normally, proteins form networks that when activated produce persistent changes in a synapse&rsquo;s molecular composition. In hippocampal neurons, calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) flux through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors activates Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin signal transduction networks that either increase or decrease the strength of the neuronal synapse, phenomena known as long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD), respectively. The calcium-sensor calmodulin (CaM) acts as a common activator of the networks responsible for both LTP and LTD. This is possible, in part, because CaM binding proteins are &ldquo;tuned&rdquo; to different Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux signals by their unique binding and activation dynamics. Computational modeling is used to describe the binding and activation dynamics of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM signal transduction and can be used to guide focused experimental studies. Although CaM binds over 100 proteins, practical limitations cause many models to include only one or two CaM-activated proteins. In this work, we view Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM as a limiting resource in the signal transduction pathway owing to its low abundance relative to its binding partners. With this view, we investigate the effect of competitive binding on the dynamics of CaM binding partner activation. Using an explicit model of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, CaM, and seven highly-expressed hippocampal CaM binding proteins, we find that competition for CaM binding serves as a tuning mechanism: the presence of competitors shifts and sharpens the Ca<sup>2+</sup> frequency-dependence of CaM binding proteins. Notably, we find that simulated competition may be sufficient to recreate the <em>in vivo</em> frequency dependence of the CaM-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. Additionally, competition alone (without feedback mechanisms or spatial parameters) could replicate counter-intuitive experimental observations of decreased activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-dependent protein kinase II in knockout models of neurogranin. We conclude that competitive tuning could be an important dynamic process underlying synaptic plasticity.</p>

This is lecture 21 of a 25-lecture seminar Deleuze taught between October 1985 and May 1986.","<p><em>The Deleuze Seminars</em> is a collection of audio recordings, transcriptions, and English translations of, and supplemental materials from, the lectures French philosopher Gilles&nbsp;Deleuze gave during his career at the University of Paris 8.</p>

<p>&quot;Foucault&quot; was a 25-lecture seminar given from October 1985 to May 1986. In these lectures, Deleuze offers his interpretation and analysis of French philosopher Michel Foucault&#39;s work. Examining the theoretical foundations and major themes of Foucault&#39;s philosophy, Deleuze dedicates several lectures to each of what he calls the &quot;three axes&quot; of Foucault&#39;s thought. This seminar coincides with the publication of Deleuze&#39;s book <em>Foucault</em> (1986).</p>

<p>In the 29 April 1986 lecture, topics of discussion include: the French botanist, anthropologist and linguist Andr&eacute; Haudricourt and the French agronomist and botanist Louis H&eacute;din; the journals <em>La Pens&eacute;e </em>(no. 171, October 1973) and <em>L&#39;homme</em> (1962); the philosophies of transcendence and immanence; the Orient and the Occident; work, agriculture and breeding; Haudricourt, the figures of the sower (<em>le semeur</em>) and the pastor, and Plato&#39;s <em>Statesman</em> (<em>Le Politique</em>); plant form (<em>la forme v&eacute;g&eacute;tale</em>) and the planter (<em>le jardini&egrave;re</em>) in Eastern thought; that thought comes from the outside (<em>dehors</em>); the outside as the most absolute distance in relation to all forms of exteriority, yet at the same time the closest to any form of interiority; Blanchot&#39;s <em>The Space of Literature</em>; the fold and the line of the outside; the place of the unthought (<em>l&#39;impens&eacute;</em>) in thought; Heidegger, the idea that &quot;we do not yet think&quot; (<em>nous ne pensons pas encore</em>), and the veiling and unveiling of thought; that what is folded in the fold is the unfold; forgetfulness, Plato and reminiscence, memory, and truth for the Greeks and unveiling; the &#39;already there&#39; (<em>d&eacute;j&agrave; l&agrave;</em>) and the &#39;not yet&#39; (<em>pas encore</em>) of temporality; subjectivity, and the subject and its doubles in Foucault&#39;s <em>The Order of Things</em>; the notion of the double as a doubling of the other; the repetition of the different; the place in immanence of a non-self (<em>non moi</em>); subjectivity in Roussel&#39;s <em>Chiquenaude</em> and <em>Impressions of Africa</em>; French symbolist writer Alfred Jarry, his book <em>Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, Pataphysician</em>, pataphysics and metaphysics, and the being of phenomenon; puns (<em>les jeux de mots</em>); the statement (<em>l&#39;&eacute;nonc&eacute;</em>) and repetition in <em>The Order of Things</em>; French surrealist writer and ethnographer Michel Leiris, the fold of being and the Greeks; the confrontation between Foucault and Heidegger; that if the folding of the line of the outside has meaning it is that it turns the line of the outside away from death (<em>se d&eacute;tourne de la mort</em>) and produces a subjectivity, encompassing (<em>s&#39;entourner</em>) itself with folds; that the folding of statements produces their doubles; the etymological exercises of Heidegger and Roussel; the question of the invention of philosophy by the Greeks as the question for German romanticism; the concepts of territory and foundation and how to return (<em>rejoindre</em>) to the earth and the sacred; Heidegger, the first act of developing a territory, clearing (<em>d&eacute;frichement</em>) and deforestation (<em>d&eacute;boisement</em>), the Greek light, the revelation of being, and the clearing (<em>la clairi&egrave;re</em>); Heidegger, French philosopher Jean Beaufret, and the verb &#39;to be&#39; (<em>&ecirc;tre</em>) as the word around which all Greek language folds; German philosopher G.W.F. Hegel, and Being as beings, both in space (the clearing) and in the verb (the copula); Descartes and the philosophy of the subject; and the three successive moments of the universal.</p>

<p>Deleuze also examines how the ancient sages expressed themselves first through poetry and the later rise of the society of &#39;friends of wisdom&#39; and the subsequent development of wisdom in three directions: 1) the philosophical direction (from Hegel to Heidegger), the French philologist and historian Ernest Renan and the Greek miracle, and <em>aletheia</em>; 2) the appearance of the philosophical speech (<em>la parole philosophique</em>), the school of French Hellenists, and the appearance of a new space of the thought in the works of French historian and anthropologist Jean-Pierre Vernant, French historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet, and Belgian classicist and historian Marcel Detienne; and 3) the political direction and Foucault&#39;s <em>The History of Sexuality, Vol. 3: The Use of Pleasure </em>(<em>L&#39;usage des plaisirs</em>).</p>

<p>This dataset includes: five mp3 recordings of the lecture (total time, 2:49:21), an aggregate version of the audio recordings into a single mp3, and the complete French transcription of the recorded lecture in both pdf (28 pp) and plain text.</p>

<p>Note: In the part 4 audio file, from the (approx.) 32:38 mark to the end of the file has not been transcribed. This corresponds to the (approx.) 2:18:48-2:32:15 marks of the complete audio file.</p>

For decoding, the study presents a stand-alone, efficient, reliable, and generalizable strategy to decode cortical fMRI activity to directly reconstruct the visual and semantic experiences during natural vision.

Specifically, the data have been used to 1) explore the potential confounds of this paradigm (Lu et al., 2016) and 2) investigate the structure of the BOLD signal observed in white matter using natural vision (Marussich et al., 2017).<br />
<br />
Thirteen subjects underwent four fMRI sessions with two conditions. Two sessions were obtained in the eyes-closed resting state, and the other two sessions occurred during free-viewing of an identical movie clip The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, 1966, from 162:54 to 168:33 min. in the film). The visual input was presented using the MATLAB Psychophysics Toolbox, and they were delivered to subjects through a binocular goggle system (NordicNeuroLab, Norway) mounted on the head coil.&nbsp; Each movie-stimulation (task) session began with a blank gray screen presented for 42 s, followed by the movie presented for 5 min and 37 s, and ended with the blank screen again for 30 s. The resting-state sessions had the same duration as the movie-stimulation sessions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spinoza: The Velocities of Thought&rdquo; was a 14-lecture seminar given from December 1980 to March 1981. In this seminar, Deleuze revisits his examination of Baruch Spinoza&rsquo;s philosophy. Deleuze had previously published two books on Spinoza: <em>Expressionism in Philosophy: Spinoza</em> (<em>Spinoza et le probl&egrave;me de l&#39;expression</em>, 1968), and <em>Spinoza: Practical Philosophy</em> (<em>Spinoza </em>&ndash; <em>Philosophie pratique</em>, 1970, 2nd ed. 1981). The majority of these lectures were given the same year as the publication of the second edition of the latter title.</p>

<p>In the 09 December 1980 lecture, Deleuze discusses Spinoza&rsquo;s project of a pure or ethical ontology and the history of modes of existence in <em>Ethics</em>, Book IV. Topics include: Being and modes; morals and judgment; the diagram of power; actions and passions; Nicholas of Cusa&rsquo;s <em>De possest</em>; Cicero, classical natural law and natural right theory; English philosopher Thomas Hobbes and social contract theory; the social state and the state of nature; power and sadness in the priest, the tyrant and the slave; German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche and the judgment of life; power in acts effectuated by the affects joy and sadness; and power as a mode of being.</p>

<p>This dataset includes: two mp3 recordings of the lecture (total time, 2:03:57), an aggregate version of the audio recordings into a single mp3, and the complete French transcription of the recorded lecture in both pdf (19 pp) and plain text.</p>

This is lecture 8 of a 21-lecture seminar Deleuze taught between November 1981 and June 1982.","<p><em>The Deleuze Seminars</em> is a collection of audio recordings, transcriptions, and English translations of, and supplemental materials from, the lectures French philosopher Gilles&nbsp;Deleuze gave during his career at the University of Paris 8.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Movement-Image: Bergsonian Lessons on Cinema&rdquo; was a 21-lecture seminar given from November 1981 to June 1982. This seminar marks the first of four consecutive seminars in which Deleuze presents his theory of film. Here, in large part through the philosophy of Henri Bergson, Deleuze rethinks film as a movement-image, as opposed to a succession of still frames or photographic images. Throughout the course he references a wide variety of filmmakers, critics, and philosophers. As a precursor to the publication of Deleuze&rsquo;s first of two volumes on cinema, <em>Cinema 1: The Movement-Image</em>&nbsp;(<em>Cin&eacute;ma 1. L&#39;Image-Mouvement</em>, 1983), this seminar is a valuable resource to researchers interested in Deleuze&rsquo;s film theory, as well as his larger philosophical oeuvre.</p>

<p>In the 26 January 1982 lecture, topics of discussion include: the perception-image; Annette Michelson; structural cinema; Landow&#39;s <em>Bardo Follies</em>; the video-image; the photogram-interval couple as a genetic element of the movement-image, hence another (non-human) perception; experimental cinema; the Italian film director and writer Michelangelo Antonioni; nine remarks on the perception-image; the affection-image; the American director David Wark (D.W.) Griffith; Eisenstein; the face and the close-up; Bergson&#39;s thesis that affection is &quot;a motor tendency on a sensitive nerve&quot;; the face and intensive series; and Descartes&rsquo; treatise&nbsp;<em>Passions of the Soul</em>.</p>

<p>This dataset includes: two mp3 recordings of the lecture (total time, 2:05:35), an aggregate version of the audio recordings into a single mp3, and the complete French transcription of the recorded lecture in both pdf (24 pp) and plain text.</p>

<p>Note: a) The first (approx.) 6:40 of the part 2 audio file repeats the end of part 1, less the last (approx.) 10 seconds. The part 2 audio file was kept intact as it is of a higher quality. The duplicate audio reflects the French transcription from &ldquo;Eh bien maintenant et la prochaine fois&hellip;&rdquo; (p. 13) to the end of section 1. The duplicate audio has been removed from the aggregate audio file. b) The aggregate audio file has been downsampled.</p>

<p>&laquo;L&rsquo;image-mouvement, Leҫons bergsoniennes sur le cin&eacute;ma&raquo; &eacute;tait un s&eacute;minaire de 21 conf&eacute;rences donn&eacute; de novembre 1981 &agrave; juin 1982. Ce s&eacute;minaire marque le premier de quatre s&eacute;minaires cons&eacute;cutifs dans lesquels Deleuze pr&eacute;sente sa th&eacute;orie du film. Ici, en grande partie gr&acirc;ce &agrave; la philosophie d&#39;Henri Bergson, Deleuze repense le film comme un image-mouvement, par opposition &agrave; une succession d&#39;images fixes ou d&#39;images photographiques. Tout au long du cours, il fait r&eacute;f&eacute;rence &agrave; une grande vari&eacute;t&eacute; des cin&eacute;astes, des critiques et des philosophes. En tant que pr&eacute;curseur de la publication des premiers volumes de Deleuze sur le cin&eacute;ma, <em>Cin&eacute;ma 1. L&#39;Image-Mouvement </em>(1983), ce s&eacute;minaire est une ressource pr&eacute;cieuse pour les chercheurs int&eacute;ress&eacute;s par la th&eacute;orie du film de Deleuze, ainsi que sa plus grande &oelig;uvre philosophique.</p>

<p>Forest ecosystems in the United States (US) are facing major challenges such as climate change, exotic invasion, and fragmentation. &nbsp;It is widely believed that forest composition in the eastern US are transitioning from shade-intolerant, fire-tolerant species to shade-tolerant, fire-intolerant species, but most evidence is anecdotal or localized.&nbsp; No comprehensive studies exist to quantify the shifts in forest composition at a regional scale with broader taxonomic group. Here, we examine the genus-level compositional changes in eastern US forests to: (1) quantify the extent and magnitude of this transition, and (2) assess the influence of fire and shade tolerance on abundance change.</p>

<p><strong>Location</strong></p>

<p>Eastern United States</p>

<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>

<p>We compiled genus-level data from the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) database at two time periods in 37 states across the Eastern US. We analyzed changes in abundance with three metrics, stem density, basal area, and importance value, for ten most abundant genera (<em>Acer, Betula, Carya, Fraxinus, Nyssa, Pinus, Populus, Prunus, Quercus </em>and<em> Ulmus</em>). Genus-level fire and shade tolerance traits were estimated based on species-level published data, and these traits were used as predictors of abundance change in linear mixed effects models.</p>

<p><strong>Results</strong></p>

<p>We found that <em>Acer</em>, <em>Fraxinus</em>, <em>Pinus, Populus, </em>and <em>Prunus,</em> in general, increased their abundance during the study period. <em>Acer</em> experienced the largest amount of increases among these five genera across the study area.&nbsp; In contrast, <em>Carya</em>, <em>Nyssa</em> and <em>Quercus</em> decreased their abundance in the majority of the study region, with <em>Quercus</em> having the largest and most extensive decline. <em>Betula </em>and <em>Ulmus</em> had relatively small overall changes.</p>

<p><strong>Main Conclusions</strong></p>

<p>We found that there has been a general trend of the &nbsp;increase in fire-intolerant, shade-tolerant species, and the decrease in fire-tolerant, shade-intolerant species across the eastern US.&nbsp; Moreover, traits of fire and shade tolerance are not always interchangeable when used to predict the dynamics of a genus or species.</p>","fire tolerance, forest ecology, forestry and natural resources, mesophication, shade tolerance","Songlin Fei, Jonathan A Knott"

<p>The auditory stimulus was the first 8 min&nbsp;22 s&nbsp;of the first movement of Beethoven&rsquo;s Symphony 9 (sampling rate: 11025 Hz). This music piece was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SZ9QzGg95g"">visualized as a movie</a> through Stephen Malinowski&rsquo;s Music Animation Machine&nbsp;(<a href=""https://musanim.com"">https://musanim.com</a>). The movie offered real-time visual cues to control the timing and inform the content of musical imagery.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>This dataset contains all data from the first three subjects (age 23-26, 1 female, average 9.3 years of musical training) who participated in the study, with informed written consent obtained from each subject according to a research protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board at Purdue University.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the musical perception sessions, each subject was instructed to listen to this music with his or her eyes closed while no movie was presented. During the musical imagery sessions, each subject was instructed to imagine the music piece while watching the silent music visualization. The three subjects performed the musical-perception task eight&nbsp;times and the musical-imagery task twelve&nbsp;times. The sessions were conducted over a period of five days. Each subject also underwent six&nbsp;sessions of resting-state fMRI on a different day. In each session, the subjects were instructed to rest for 8 min&nbsp;with the eyes closed, without falling into sleep. In four additional sessions for subject 1, we also presented the music with the same visual display (the unmuted movie) as used in the musical-imagery task, yielding a control condition for us to validate findings from the intra-subject reproducibility analysis.&nbsp;</p>

We use terrains in simple crater equilibrium to constrain an analytical model of diffusive erosion model. Using LROC observations of the Apollo 15 landing site as well as a numerical Monte Carlo code called the Cratered Terrain Evolution Model, we set constraints on the cratering processes that determine the diffusive erosion rate of lunar topography. Our results show that the majority of each new crater&#39;s contribution to diffusive topographic degradation occurs over a spatially heterogeneous region much larger than that bounded by the crater&#39;s proximal ejecta blanket, possibly as much as 50x&nbsp;larger than the final crater rim diameter. This is in contrast to previous studies that assumed that the majority of topographic degradation occurred by the direct excavation and preferential downslope deposition of proximal ejecta. We conclude that the dominant mechanism for topographic degradation on the Moon is therefore related to energetic distal ejecta deposition, and it is this distal process that sets the empirical equilibrium cumulative size-frequency distribution for simple post-mare craters.</p>","eaps, planetary science","David Minton, Caleb Fassett, Masatoshi Hirabayashi, Bryan Howl, James Richardson, David A Minton"

This would mark the fourth consecutive seminar (1981-1985) which Deleuze gave on various aspects of cinema.

<p>&quot;Foucault&quot; was a 25-lecture seminar given from October 1985 to May 1986. In these lectures, Deleuze offers his interpretation and analysis of French philosopher Michel Foucault&#39;s work. Examining the theoretical foundations and major themes of Foucault&#39;s philosophy, Deleuze dedicates several lectures to each of what he calls the &quot;three axes&quot; of Foucault&#39;s thought. This seminar coincides with the publication of Deleuze&#39;s book <em>Foucault</em> (1986).</p>

<p>In the 11 March 1986 lecture, topics of discussion include: forces in humans; the relationship of forces to forms; forces and the infinite; the forces of finitude: life, language, labor (<em>le travail</em>), and where these forces fold (<em>se replient</em>) in humans; the metaphor of the fold and the unfold (<em>le d&eacute;pli</em>) in Foucault; Foucault&#39;s <em>The Birth of the Clinic</em> (<em>Naissance de la clinique</em>) and the medical gaze (<em>regard m&eacute;dical</em>); French naturalist and zoologist Georges Cuvier and the branches of life; the figures of the fold and the unfold and life; Cuvier and the finite plurality (<em>pluralit&eacute; finie</em>) of zoological body plans (<em>plans d&#39;organisations</em>); labor (<em>le travail</em>) in the seventeenth century; Scottish economist and philosopher Adam Smith and German philosopher Friedrich Engels on the labor force (<em>force de travail</em>); German philosopher and economist Karl Marx and British political economist David Ricardo on labor, capital and the fold; the folding of languages; the German poet, philosopher, and philologist Friedrich Schlegel; grammar; inflections as a pure grammatical formal element; German Romantic philology and the idea of the will of a people; the gathering (<em>rassemblement</em>) of language and the &lsquo;finite-unlimited&rsquo;; combinatorics and the genetic code; the inter-capture of fragments of codes; and the <em>&Uuml;bermensch</em>.</p>

<p>Bridges carrying I-70 eastbound and westbound traffic were replaced by the slide-in-bridge construction method. The $5.6 million project was constructed by Walsh Construction Company. Benefits to using the slide-in-bridge construction method are accelerated construction scheduling, increased safety, reduced traffic maintenance costs, minimized traffic impacts, and improved construction quality.</p>

<p>The new bridge was temporarily constructed in the median while traffic was allowed to flow unrestricted in both the eastbound and westbound directions. Temporary crossovers were constructed to divert traffic off one of the two bridges for bridge replacement.</p>

<p>The Rough Cilicia Survey Project Study Collection was created by Richard M. Rothaus of St. Cloud State U. in 1997. The purpose was to bring order to the large scale grab collections being processed by the survey team in 1996-97. The process of selection for the Study Collection is described in the accompanying publication N. K. Rauh and R. Rothaus, &ldquo;Caveat Emptor: Collecting and Processing Pottery in Western Rough Cilicia?&rdquo;<em> Old Pottery in a New Century. Innovating Perspectives on Roman Pottery Studies</em>, ed. J. Lund, J. Poblome, D. Malfitana, Rome: L&rsquo;Erma di Bretschneider, 2006, pp. 347-362. Organizing the collection according to &quot;Rothaus Numbers,&quot; Richard assembled most of the Study Collection from the ceramics grab collections that the team assembled at the large urban sites along the coast (Laertes, Iotape, Selinus, Kestros, Nephelion, and Antiochia ad Cragum). Drawings were commenced by Ankara University student, Betul Sahin, and descriptions by Jason DeBlock and Nicholas Rauh of Purdue University. At the end of the 1997 season, Kathleen W. Slane of the University of Missouri at Columbia visited the survey headquarters to review the work and made some valuable additions, revisions, and emendations. Since its inception the RCSP Study Collection has been safely stored in the Alanya Archaeological Museum. We express our gratitude to Ismail Karamut and Seher Turkmen of the Alanya Museum for their long-standing support of the project.</p>

<p>The survey team has relied on the Study Collection to identify ceramic materials encountered in the field. From 1999 &ndash; 2011, Rauh, team collaborator Matthew Dillon of Loyola Marymount U., and numerous student participants devoted countless hours photographing, measuring, Munselling, revising, and conserving the collection. Rothaus revisited the survey in 2001, and incorporated several new forms into the collection. That season E. Lyding Will of U. Massachusetts at Amherst also made important contributions to our understanding of the amphora remains. John Lund and Tamar Hodos also visited briefly and offered important recommendations. Kim Leaman of Purdue University spent several seasons revising and expanding our set of profile drawings. Most of the drawings in the collection are Leaman&rsquo;s, in fact. In 2005, Rothaus made one final visit to the survey and added several new items to the collection from the survey materials of the Adanda Canyon and Bickici Highland phase of the survey (2000-2004). He was assisted by illustrator Burhan S&uuml;er from Bilkent U. in Ankara. In 2008 Caroline Autret of the U. Paris-Sorbonne, joined the team and greatly enhanced our understanding of locally produced amphoras. Since 2015, H.

In excitatory neurons, synaptic plasticity occurs when calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) flux through NMDA receptors and bind the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor calmodulin (CaM). The activation of downstream Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding proteins (CBPs) is a function of the frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux, such that each CBP is preferentially &ldquo;tuned&rdquo; to different Ca<sup>2+</sup> input signals. We have recently reported that competition among CBPs for CaM binding is alone sufficient to recreate <em>in silico</em> the observed <em>in vivo</em> frequency-dependence of several CBPs. However, CBP activation may strongly depend on the identity and concentration of proteins that constitute the competitive pool; with important implications in the regulation of CBPs that are implicated in learning and memory disorders.</p>

<p><u>Methods:</u> We hypothesize that although perturbations may decrease activation of one CBP, increased activation of another CBP could compensate this loss, providing a homeostatic effect.

<p>&quot;Foucault&quot; was a 25-lecture seminar given from October 1985 to May 1986. In these lectures, Deleuze offers his interpretation and analysis of French philosopher Michel Foucault&#39;s work. Examining the theoretical foundations and major themes of Foucault&#39;s philosophy, Deleuze dedicates several lectures to each of what he calls the &quot;three axes&quot; of Foucault&#39;s thought. This seminar coincides with the publication of Deleuze&#39;s book <em>Foucault</em> (1986).</p>

<p>In the 05 November 1985 lecture, topics of discussion include: the series of shifts (<em>d&eacute;placements</em>) in Foucault&#39;s philosophy: the question of knowledge, followed by the question of power, followed by the question of desire; why and how the shift from knowledge to power fits into Foucault&#39;s philosophy; archeology as the extraction of the statements of a period; words, phrases and propositions as that which is immediately given; Austro&ndash;German psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing and his <em>Psychopathia Sexualis</em>; that to find statements (<em>&eacute;nonc&eacute;s</em>) it is necessary to constitute a corpus; American linguists Leonard Bloomfield and Zellig Harris, distributionalism and unlocking the patterns that define statements; French sociologist Gabriel Tarde and microsociology; statements of the nineteenth century; the concept of corpus, and the focal points (<em>les foyers</em>) of power and of resistance; the dimension in which language is given; the being of language as historical; the gathering of language as linked to a historical formation (representation for the seventeenth century, literature for the nineteenth century); French philosopher Maurice Blanchot&#39;s theory of literature as irreducible to representation, of which French poet St&eacute;phane Mallarm&eacute; is an example; linguistics presupposing that every corpus is relative; that there is never a beginning of language; being-language and the anonymous murmur; the silent meaning (<em>le sens muet</em>) of things and the world, and phenomenology; the gathering of language and the &quot;we speak&quot; (<em>on parle</em>), the anonymous murmur or statement; the corpus of visibility; the being-light of each period; a painting (<em>un tableau</em>) as a gathering of light; Raymond Roussel; and how the being-language and the being-light of the same period are heterogeneous.</p>

In these lectures, Deleuze offers his interpretation and analysis of French philosopher Michel Foucault&#39;s work. Examining the theoretical foundations and major themes of Foucault&#39;s philosophy, Deleuze dedicates several lectures to each of what he calls the &quot;three axes&quot; of Foucault&#39;s thought. This seminar coincides with the publication of Deleuze&#39;s book <em>Foucault</em> (1986).</p>

<p>In the 26 November 1985 lecture, topics of discussion include: knowledge (<em>le savoir</em>) as interlacing, and the heterogeneity of the visible and of the statable (<em>l&#39;&eacute;nonҫable</em>); the non-relationship of the visible and the statable as shown in Foucault humorously, logically, and historically; the concept of delinquency, the prison, the delinquency-object, and delinquency-illegality; the non-isomorphism between the visible and the statable; the primacy of the statement as determinant; the mutual capture between the visible and the statable; French philosopher Ren&eacute; Descartes and the cogito; Kant, the cogito, receptivity, spontaneity and the schema of the imagination; the schema as a determination of space and time, in accordance with a concept, thus enabling the construction of the object; the classical conception of death; French anatomist and pathologist Marie Fran&ccedil;ois Xavier Bichat and the determination of life, the coextension of death to life, and death as no longer indivisible (<em>ins&eacute;cable</em>) but disseminated, multiple and partial; Blanchot and <em>The Infinite Conversation</em>; the image without resemblance; the view, the visible from a distance, and the dream; Blanchot and Foucault; and the cinema and the distribution of audio and of the visual. In the second part of the lecture, Deleuze discusses the fundamental heterogeneity of the visible and the statable in terms of confrontations with: 1) Kant, and the two faculties: receptivity (visibility) and spontaneity (the statement); 2) Blanchot and the idea that &quot;to speak (<em>parler</em>) is not to see (<em>voir</em>)&quot;; 3) the cinema, and the gap (<em>faille</em>) between audio and the visual, between the visible and speech, with consideration of&nbsp; the French writer and filmmaker Marguerite Duras, the German director Hans-J&uuml;rgen Syberberg, and the French filmmaker Jean-Marie Straub; and 4) the work of Roussel.</p>

<p>This dataset includes: four mp3 recordings of the lecture (total time, 2:31:50), an aggregate version of the audio recordings into a single mp3, and the complete French transcription of the recorded lecture in both pdf (28 pp) and plain text.</p>

The reference files lists all sources of data.</p>

<p>Phenylalanine (Phe) is a key nutrient in the dietary management of the metabolic disease phenylketonuria (PKU). To give more freedom to PKU patients, we propose a numerical process to estimate the Phe content of a commercial food using the information printed on the label (Nutritional Fact Label and ordered ingredient list). The process is amenable to implementation as a smart phone/Web app and could be integrated into a personalized dietary management software. Our tests show that the results are very accurate (&plusmn;13 mg per serving) in the vast majority of foods considered. Our approach can be modified to handle any other amino acid for the management of other inborn errors of metabolism. A similar approach can also be used for improving the precision (i.e., increasing the quantization resolution) of the nutrients already listed (e.g., protein).</p>

A fundamental goal of disease ecology is to determine the landscape and environmental<br />
processes that drive disease dynamics at different biological levels to<br />
guide management and conservation. Although ranaviruses (family Iridoviridae)<br />
are emerging amphibian pathogens, few studies have conducted comprehensive<br />
field surveys to assess potential drivers of ranavirus disease dynamics.</p>

<p>2. We examined the factors underlying patterns in site-level ranavirus presence and<br />
individual-level ranavirus infection in 76 ponds and 1,088 individuals representing<br />
five amphibian species within the East Bay region of California.</p>

<p>3. Based on a competing-model approach followed by variance partitioning, landscape<br />
and biotic variables explained the most variation in site-level presence. However, biotic<br />
and individual-level variables explained the most variation in individual-level infection.</p>

<p>4. Distance to nearest ranavirus-infected pond (the landscape factor) was more important<br />
than biotic factors at the site level; however, biotic factors were most influential<br />
at the individual level. At the site level, the probability of ranavirus presence<br />
correlated negatively with distance to nearest ranavirus-positive pond, suggesting<br />
that the movement of water or mobile taxa (e.g., adult amphibians, birds, reptiles)<br />
may facilitate the movement of ranavirus between ponds and across the landscape.</p>

<p>5. Taxonomic richness associated positively with ranavirus presence at the site<br />
level, but vertebrate richness associated negatively with infection prevalence in<br />
the host population. This might reflect the contrasting influences of diversity on<br />
pathogen colonisation versus transmission among hosts.</p>

<p>6. Amphibian host species differed in their likelihood of ranavirus infection: American<br />
bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) had the weakest association with infection while roughskinned<br />
newts (Taricha granulosa) had the strongest. After accounting for host species<br />
effects, hostswith greater snout&ndash;vent length had a lower probability of infection.</p>

<p>7. Our study demonstrates the array of landscape, environmental, and individual level<br />
factors associated with ranavirus epidemiology. Moreover, our study helps<br />
illustrate that the importance of these factors varies with biological level.</p>","amphibian, dilution effect, disease ecology, emerging infectious diseases, forestry and natural resources, iridovirus, multimodel inference, ranavirus, reservoir species","Brian James Tornabene, Jason T.

ABSTRACT</p>

<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects approximately 1.7 million Americans annually. Over 5.3 million persons in the US are living with a TBI-related disability, which costs about $60 billion annually. TBI is a multi-dimensional injury that requires multi-disciplinary care teams to coordinate and deliver care. Due to the unique symptoms and outcomes of each TBI patient, rehabilitation must be highly tailored and individualized. Clinicians want to know if their treatments for a specific patient are effective for that patient. The goal of this research is to determine the data needed for clinical decision support tools that would allow rehabilitation professional teams to track the short-term and long-term recovery of TBI survivors in a timely and effective manner. Specifically, this dissertation&rsquo;s overarching goals are to: 1) map the processes of TBI rehabilitation with providers at each process stage; 2) define the roles of each provider and their expertise; 3) specify the information needs for each provider and their information flows in the process over time; and 4) consider future technological advances that might benefit care delivery coordination in this process. This functional needs assessment used semi-structured interviews (n = 32) to determine the needs of the professional care providers involved in the rehabilitation process for adult civilian TBI survivors.</p>

<p>The findings from this work informed process maps, which were useful in understanding team coordination, and highlighted the information handoffs that occur at various levels of the system (e.g. shift-change level, healthcare system transfer level). Content analysis identified process characteristics, such as differences in TBI care in athletic programs versus purely clinical settings. This analysis also identified and defined over 30 key professional roles, their expertise, and their information needs. Provider role definitions highlighted the criticality of multi-disciplinary teamwork due to the need for different perspectives and consistency of treatment. Thus, the coordination and communication in TBI response, recovery, and rehabilitation may need to be even more robust than in some other disease populations. While each professional role in TBI rehabilitation varies in their information needs, there was a general consensus in wanting to know &ldquo;everything&rdquo; about the patient. Certain information types and formats are prioritized differently for each TBI professional. All professionals want timely information, although their time-scales for what is considered &ldquo;timely&rdquo; varied. In general, the earlier the patient is in the care continuum, the more frequent information updates (i.e., multiple updates per hour or day) for providers are desired/necessary. Finally, barriers and facilitators to care were identified. The findings from two use cases informed information architectures for building a system that can house the various data formats of professionals&rsquo; information needs and support their sensemaking and coordination with other providers in TBI rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Recommendations for improvement and areas for future work include telehealth and telemedicine interventions, automated patient data collection, information system (re)design, resource allocation analysis, and macro-ergonomic handoff research. Just as no one clinical discipline &ldquo;owns&rdquo; TBI care, the numerous functional needs identified in this study cannot be addressed by one discipline or field. There are numerous research and development opportunities for persons from multiple disciplines and fields, especially engineering; they are invited to join the &ldquo;team&rdquo; in improving the complex system that is TBI rehabilitation.</p>","brain, industrial engineering, process","Siobhan M Heiden"

It also determined the effect on the tomato herbivore, the tobacco hornworm.","<ol>
	<li value=""NaN"">Although crop rotation has been used for centuries to enhance agricultural production, there are surprisingly little data justifying the use of one rotation over another. Growers typically avoid growing plants in succession that belong to the same genus or family, but it is not clear whether closely related crops are indeed poor rotation partners and whether evolutionary history, overall, predicts legacy effects in agricultural soils.</li>
	<li value=""NaN"">Here, we use a plant-soil feedback framework to test the relationship between species relatedness and crop growth. Using tomato <em>Solanum lycopersicum</em> as our focal crop, we determined how 36 common crop and weed species that vary along a spectrum of phylogenetic relatedness influence tomato growth in subsequent plantings. We also tested whether soil conditioning affects the performance of an aboveground insect herbivore, the tobacco hornworm <em>Manduca sexta</em>.</li>
	<li value=""NaN"">Phylogenetic relatedness did not predict plant-soil feedback effects on tomato biomass or hornworm performance; rather, impacts of soil conditioning were highly species- or family-specific. For example, tomatoes growing in soil previously containing plants in the Asteraceae family were notably resistant to caterpillar feeding.</li>
	<li value=""NaN"">There was also a disconnect between which plant species caused negative feedbacks on tomatoes vs. hornworms (e.g., thistle <em>Cirsium discolor</em> soil had strong negative effects on herbivory but no impact on plant growth). Hence, negative feedbacks on hornworms are likely due to enhanced defence instead of simply reducing leaf availability.</li>
	<li value=""NaN""><em>Synthesis and applications:</em> These data demonstrate that, despite being widely recommended by agronomists in most cropping systems, phylogenetic relatedness is a poor predictor for the success of crop pairings in rotation, especially in tomato. Better understanding of species-specific effects of soil conditioning will lend insight into how polycultures can be better designed to optimize crop growth while reducing susceptibility to insect pests, which is particularly useful on diversified farms that cultivate a variety of crop species.</li>

Deleuze also discusses the following three problems: 1) What are the new struggles in relation to new forms of possible struggle? Is there a new role for the intellectual in these struggles, and in relation to old or new knowledges?

Ce s&eacute;minaire co&iuml;ncide avec la publication du livre de Deleuze <em>Foucault</em> (1986).</p>

<p>Dans la conf&eacute;rence du 13 mai 1986, les sujets de discussion comprennent: la subjectivation selon Foucault; quatre aspects du pli: 1) le pli et le corps, 2) la r&egrave;gle du pli, 3) la rapport entre le sujet et le vrai, et 4) la vie dans les plis et ce que le sujet est en droit d&#39;attendre; les Grecs et la subjectivation; le pli de la force sur soi-m&ecirc;me; la rivalit&eacute; entre les agents libres; le marxisme et la subjectivation; la dimension esth&eacute;tique de la subjectivation; le philosophe marxiste allemand Ernst Bloch et son concept de l&#39;utopie concr&egrave;te; les m&eacute;thodes individuantes du pouvoir s&rsquo;exerҫant sur la subjectivation; la production de subjectivations historiques qui ne passent pas par le savoir et le pouvoir; l&#39;oubli des anciennes pouvoirs et le manque d&#39;archa&iuml;sme pour les subjectivations; la m&eacute;moire comme un pli, comme subjectivation; la vari&eacute;t&eacute; des modes de subjectivation; la dialectique h&eacute;g&eacute;lienne; la diff&eacute;rence entre le syst&eacute;mique (&eacute;tudes des syst&egrave;mes en d&eacute;s&eacute;quilibre, les unit&eacute;s h&eacute;t&eacute;rog&egrave;nes entre elles, et les relations transversales d&#39;une unit&eacute; &agrave; une autre) et le syst&eacute;matique (dialectique et homog&egrave;ne); et luttes sociales et de nouveaux modes de subjectivation. Deleuze discute aussi les trois probl&egrave;mes suivants: 1) Quelles sont les nouvelles luttes par rapport aux nouvelles formes de lutte &eacute;ventuelles? Y a-t-il un nouveau r&ocirc;le pour l&#39;intellectuel dans ces luttes et par rapport aux savoirs anciens ou nouveaux? Comment des modes de subjectivation qui ont leurs propres r&egrave;gles entrent en rapport avec les nouvelles luttes?</p>","20th century french philosophy, ancient greeks, audio recording, concrete utopia, deleuze recordings, deleuze seminars, dialectics, ernst bloch, gilles deleuze, g.w.f. hegel, marxism, memory, michel foucault, philosophy, philosophy of power, social struggles, subjectivity, the fold, theory of knowledge","Gilles Deleuze, Matthew Kroll"

It is an alternative to the traditional discrete threshold-based classifications. The dataset includes the U.S. county-level IRR for 2000 and...","<p>The Index of Relative Rurality (IRR) is a continuous, threshold-free, and unit-free measure of rurality. The original version of the IRR was proposed by Waldorf (2006, <a href=""http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/21383"">http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/21383</a>) as an alternative to the traditional discrete threshold-based classifications, such as the Rural-urban Continuum Code and the Urban Influence Code. Waldorf and Kim (2015) designed an improved county level IRR for 2000 and 2010.</p>

<p>The IRR has three major advantages over typology-based rurality measures. (1) It is spatially flexible in that it can be designed for any spatial units; (2) it is a relative measure and thus embeds rurality in the broader system of settlements; (3) it is analytically more easily handled than threshold-based typologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The IRR ranges between 0 (low level of rurality, i.e., urban) and 1 (most rural). Four steps are involved in its design:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Identifying the dimensions of rurality: population size, density, remoteness, and built-up area.</li>
	<li>Selecting measureable variables to adequately represent each dimension:
	<ol style=""list-style-type:lower-alpha;"">
		<li>Size: logarithm of population size</li>
		<li>Density: &nbsp;logarithm of population density.</li>
		<li>Remoteness: network distance.</li>
		<li>Built-up area: urban area (as defined by the US Census Bureau) as a percentage of total land area.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Re-scaling the variables onto bounded scales that range from 0 to 1.</li>
	<li>Selecting a link function: unweighted average of the four re-scaled variable.</li>

<p>We wrote a Perl script in order to facilitate locating the genomic positions of clusters of ZFBS-Morph overlaps along the mammalian chromosomes.&nbsp; This script produces density-plots, in which peaks mark the position of ZFBS-Morph-overlap clusters.&nbsp; This publication offers a file that includes the density-plots obtained for the build mm9 of the mouse genome.&nbsp; These plots are in a format (wig.gz) suitable for display as a custom track, at the UCSC genome browser.</p>

Prairie, forest and river ecosystems that support diverse plant and animal communities are also found within the MRB. Because of an increase and intensification of agricultural production in the MRB since European settlement, plant and animal habitats have degraded.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To address water quality and wildlife issues in the MRB, a partnership between researchers at the US Geologic Service, Oregon State University, and Purdue University created a project to investigate the barriers and opportunities of adoption of conservation practices by agricultural producers in three sub-watersheds in the MRB. This investigation also gauged rates of adoption of different conservation practices which increase water quality or habitat that qualify for federal cost-share programs. Understanding what factors influence farmers&rsquo; management decisions can help researchers understand why practices are adopted or have a high likelihood of adoption now or in the future. Understanding decision making as it relates to adoption can inform water quality and habitat models that predict what may happen to hypoxic areas in the Gulf of Mexico in the future if there are precipitation and temperature changes in the MRB.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following data are the results of interviews with 36 agricultural producers in Big Creek watershed located in Posey County in southwestern Indiana and Lime Creek watershed located in Buchanan and Benton Counties in northeastern Iowa. Interviewees were asked to discuss their current use of conservation practices and their willingness to change their use of conservation practices in the future due to projected climate changes in the Upper Midwest.</p>","agriculture, climate change, conservation, forestry and natural resources, indiana, interviews, iowa, water quality","Ajay Singh, Linda Stalker Prokopy, Laura A Esman"

<p>&ldquo;The Movement-Image: Bergsonian Lessons on Cinema&rdquo;&nbsp;marks the first of four consecutive seminars in which Deleuze presents his theory of film.

Throughout the course he references a wide variety of filmmakers, critics, and philosophers. As a precursor to the publication of Deleuze&rsquo;s first of two volumes on cinema, <em>Cinema 1: The Movement-Image</em>&nbsp;(<em>Cin&eacute;ma 1.

To answer this question, the authors construct a data set of all confirmed uses of lethal force by police officers in the United States in 2014 and 2015.

<p>Core ideas from the paper include: 1) Systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrate key factors for reducing agricultural N losses. 2) Nitrification inhibitors and side-dress fertilizer N each reduce N<sub>2</sub>O losses by ~30%. 3) Temperature controls N<sub>2</sub>O emissions and precipitation controls NO<sub>3</sub> leaching losses. 4) Higher levels of soil carbon reduce NO<sub>3</sub> losses, but increase N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. 5) Lack of simultaneous data for N<sub>2</sub>O and NO<sub>3</sub> impedes understanding of tradeoffs and synergies.</p>

<p><u><strong>Article Abstract</strong></u></p>

<p>CO<sub>2</sub>, temperature, water availability and light intensity were all potential selective pressures to propel the initial evolution and global expansion of C<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;photosynthesis over the last 30 million years. To tease apart how the primary selective pressures varied along this evolutionary trajectory, we coupled photosynthesis and hydraulics models while optimizing photosynthesis over stomatal resistance and leaf/fine-root allocation. We further examined the importance of resource (e.g. nitrogen) reallocation from the dark to the light reactions during and after the initial formation of C<sub>4</sub>syndrome. We show here that the primary selective pressures &minus; all acting upon photorespiration in C<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;progenitors &minus; changed through the course of C<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;evolution. The higher stomatal resistance and leaf-to-root allocation ratio enabled by the C<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;carbon-concentrating mechanism led to a C<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;advantage without any change in hydraulic properties, but selection on nitrogen reallocation varied. Water limitation was the primary driver for the initial evolution of C<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;25-32 million years ago, and could positively select for C<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;evolution with atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;as high as 600 ppm. Under these high CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;conditions, nitrogen reallocation was necessary. Low CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;and light intensity, but not nitrogen reallocation, were the primary drivers during the global radiation of C<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;5-10 MYA. Finally, our results suggest that identifying the predominate selective pressures at the time C<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;first evolved within a lineage should help explain current biogeographical distributions.</p>

<p>Understanding biodiversity-productivity relationships (BPRs) is of theoretical importance, and has important management implications.&nbsp; Most work on BPRs has focused on simple and/or experimentally assembled communities, and it is unclear how these observed BPRs can be extended to complex natural forest ecosystems.&nbsp; Using data from over 115,000 forest plots across the contiguous United States, we show that the bivariate BPRs are positive in dry climates and hump-shaped in mesic.&nbsp; When considering other site characteristics, BPRs change to neutral in dry climates and remain hump-shaped in humid sites.&nbsp; Our results indicate that climatic variation is an underlying determinant of contrasting BPRs observed across a large spatial extent, while both biotic factors (e.g., stand age and density) and abiotic factors (e.g., soil properties) can impact BPRs within a given climate unit.&nbsp; These findings suggest that tradeoffs need be made when considering whether to maximize productivity vs. conserve biodiversity, especially in mesic climates.</p>","biodiversity, climate, forest, forestry and natural resources, productivity","Insu Jo, Songlin Fei"

This data was used for the following publication at CHI 2019: A Practice-Led Account of the Conceptual Evolution of UX Knowledge...","<p>Our study site is the user experience (UX) community supported by Stack Exchange. Stack Exchange is a large network of 170 Q&amp;A communities, including Stack Overfow, which focuses on programming and is one of the most widely studied Q&amp;A sites by researchers. The UX community we are studying belongs to this network, and had its first question asked on September 22th, 2008. We used the official Stack Exchange API to collect Q&amp;A communication among UX practitioners from September 2008 to September 2017, including a total of 21,216 questions, 56,486 answers, and 9,936 unique authors who had written at least one question or answer.</p>

<p>Our study asks: What concepts and knowledge categories characterize this body of UX knowledge? We considered identified nouns as a candidate for a UX concept. We used the <a href=""https://doi.org/10.3115/1073445.1073478"">Stanford Log-linear Part-Of-Speech Tagger</a> to process all text in our dataset, and generated a set of UX concept candidates, each provided along with their frequencies in our dataset. The initial candidate list contained 53,281 words, with their fre&shy;quencies following a long-tailed distribution (max = 90,938, min = 1, avg = 37.5, std = 557.5).</p>

<p>The criteria we used to delimit a UX concept was that a word must have an unam&shy;biguous meaning that is relevant to UX design. For example, &ldquo;time&rdquo; is not a UX concept, because it can be either used as a generic everyday word, or used to refer to the temporal qual&shy;ity of design. &ldquo;User,&rdquo; on the other hand, has the unambiguous meaning that people who use a designed thing. Two coders, who have experience and expertise in researching and teach&shy;ing UX, double coded all the candidates. For words that the two coders disagreed over, they went to the actual Q&amp;A communication to check if the word was used with only one meaning. Through this process, we were able to generate a set of 602 UX concepts that we consider a representation of UX knowledge.</p>

<p>We used <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2003.10.001"">qualitative content analysis</a> to code all the 602 concepts. The unit of analysis was at the concept level, and the coding was performed in an inductive manner. The same two coders assigned a code to each concept individually. They then discussed and compared their list of codes while moving back and forth between codes and concepts. With a consolidated code list, the two coders engaged in further abstraction, drawing from their collective interpretations of codes. In the end, we generated six primary categories. Each primary category contains one or more secondary categories.</p>","computer graphics technology, design, design knowledge, social media, stack exchange, user experience","Colin Gray, Colin M.

<p>Research activities were carried out on Black Chernozemic soils at the University of Alberta Ellerslie research farm in Edmonton, AB and on Dark Brown Chernozemic soils at the Alberta Agriculture and Forestry Farm in Lethbridge, AB.</p>

<p>Recommended N rates were based on soil samples taken in the fall prior to both growing seasons. For the Ellerslie site, the recommended N rate was 80 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> for both years, resulting in N rate treatments of 0, 40, 80 and 120 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>, corresponding to the 0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 levels. For the Lethbridge site, the recommended N rate was 60 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>, for both years, resulting in N rate treatments of 0, 30, 60 and 90 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>, corresponding to the 0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 levels.</p>

<p>At Ellerslie, annual and growing season precipitation was slightly below normal for both growing seasons (365 and 348 mm of growing season precipitation). At Lethbridge, growing season precipitation was adequate in 2016 (260 mm), but there was a significant drought late in the 2017 growing season and there was only 154 mm of growing season precipitation.</p>

<p>Despite soil tests indicating N deficiency, wheat yield response to added N fertilizer was inconsistent and low regardless of fertilizer type at both sites, but greater response was observed at Ellerslie. The highest observed yields were not consistently associated with a given fertilizer type at either site in either year. At Ellerslie, wheat grain yields varied from 2200 to 3700 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> (30 &ndash; 50 bu/ac) in 2016 and from 3100 to 4100 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> (46 to 61 bu/ac) in 2017.&nbsp; At Lethbridge, wheat grain yields varied from 4200 to 4800 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> (61 &ndash; 73 bu/ac) in 2016 and from 3300 to 4800 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> (49 to 73 bu/ac) in 2017. Because soil samples for fertilizer recommendations were taken in the fall when soil conditions are dry, it is possible that soil test nitrate was not representative of the potential N supplying power of the soil.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With respect to cumulative N<sub>2</sub>O emissions , the controlled release, polymer-coated product (ESN) consistently showed higher average N<sub>2</sub>O emissions compared to conventional urea in all cases except when spring-banded at Lethbridge in 2016, but these differences were not consistently, statistically significant. There were also significant late-season fluxes (July, August) in the ESN treatments at the Ellerslie site in both growing seasons .&nbsp; The significant late season fluxes are likely because there was still significant amounts of urea being released from the fertilizer prills into the soil late in the growing season, resulting excess available N when crop uptake was low.</p>

<p>The products with nitrification inhibitors (eNtrench) and urease inhibitors (SuperU) did not consistently show lower average N<sub>2</sub>O emissions compared to conventional urea. It appears that inhibitor efficacy was reduced under the growing conditions that occurred during these growing seasons. Peak daily N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes were associated with soil thawing for fall-banded treatments, and following significant precipitation events after seeding for both fall- and spring-banded treatments.&nbsp; These peak flux events account for a large proportion of the annual cumulative emissions. However, with the exception of fall-banded SuperU at Ellerslie in 2016, and spring-banded eNtrench at Ellerslie in 2017, inhibitor-treated urea did not show significantly lower peak fluxes compared to conventional urea.</p>

<p>If the efficacy of the inhibitors in the SuperU and eNtrech products were reduced, the reasons are not clear at this point. There is some evidence in the literature than soil organic matter levels may influence the efficacy of nitrification inhibitors&nbsp; Another possibility is that soil freeze-thaw cycles may affect the efficacy of inhibitors, but this is only a hypothesis. These products have performed well in other locations in western Canada.</p>

<p>For producers, regardless of fertilizer type, the best way to reduced emissions and increase crop yields is to place fertilizer bands as close to the seed row as possible and deeper than the seed row to ensure that the crop will be able to access applied N as early in the growing season as possible.</p>","4r, agronomy, ipni, nitrogen fertilizer, nitrous oxide, soil emissions","Miles Dyck, Len Kryzanowski, Yuanpei Gao, Dick Puurveen"

<p>RNAseq experiments included in this analysis include plant tissue samples (flower bud, flower at anthesis, flower post- anthesis, young shoot, leaves treated with methyl jasmonate,&nbsp;small green fruit, expanding green fruit, pink fruit, ripe fruit and salt-treated and untreated roots). Additional experiments included&nbsp;three biological replicates each of berries at seven developmental stages (petal fall/cup, small green fruit, expanding green fruit, pink fruit, purple reddish fruit, purple unripe fruit and blue ripe fruit).</p>

<p>Counts of uniquely mapping reads were generated through HTSeq for all 35 RNAseq datasets.&nbsp;To construct the gene co-expression network, genes that were not expressed or very weakly expressed (count&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;5) in 30 or more conditions were first excluded from the analysis. The count data was then transformed into variance stabilized values using the variance stabilizing transformation (VST) function in DEseq. Pairwise correlations of gene expression was calculated using Pearson&rsquo;s correlation coefficient (PCC) and mutual rank (MR). MR scores were transformed to network edge weights using geometric decay functions; five different co-expression networks were constructed based on different rates of geometric decay. Edges with PCC&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.6 or edge weight&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.01 was excluded. For each network, modules of co-expressed genes were detected using ClusterONE v1.0 using default parameters, and modules with&nbsp;Pvalue&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0.1 or quality score&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.2 were excluded. The results from all co-expression networks were then combined by collapsing modules into metamodules of nonoverlapping gene sets.</p>

<p>Our analysis identified 1988 metamodules of co-expressed genes, of which, 428 metamodules contained at least one of the 57 Pfam domains that have been previously categorized as associated with specialized metabolic pathways in plants. Our analysis revealed that 142 of 428 metamodules were more highly expressed in developing fruit compared to other plant tissues. Some metamodules showed clear trends of being highly expressed during either early or late fruit development. For example, METAMOD00377 is expressed early in fruit development and contains homologs to known anthocyanin genes&nbsp;OMT, HCT, PAL, HQT&nbsp;as well as 31 homologs to known transcription factors. In contrast, METAMOD01221 is expressed late in fruit development and contains homologs of&nbsp;HCT, TT19, UFGT, OMT&nbsp;and contains 10 homologs to known transcription factors. Moreover, we also examined metamodules for genes associated with other biosynthetic pathways which impart unique blueberry fruit characteristics. We identified two metamodules where genes appear to be co-regulated. Metamodule METAMOD00377 contains Pfam domains associated with terpene, saccharide, and alkaloid specialized metabolism and METAMOD01221 which contains terpene and saccharide metabolism. These metamodules contained genes that are differentially expressed during fruit development. Overall, the developmental-specific expression patterns of key biosynthetic genes and their putative transcriptional regulators emphasizes the tight regulation of production, conversion and transport of precursor compounds that lead to the accumulation of antioxidant-related metabolites in blueberry.</p>

In modern terms the RCSP area rested within the confines of two provinces (Antalya and Icel) encompassing three districts (Alanya, Gazipaşa, and Kaledran). Field seasons in Gazipaşa continued until 2011, with study seasons in the Alanya Archaeological Museum still on going. To obtain a balanced appraisal of the urbanization of western Rough Cilicia, the RCSP survey team monitored evidence for relationships of cultural reception in the region within the context of world system theory. More precisely, we asked whether or not native elites so assimilated Greco-Roman cultural attributes that their own attributes essentially merged with and became indistinguishable from these. Toward this end, team investigators examined the archaeological remains of western Rough Cilicia with the highest degree of sensitivity possible, one capable of detecting relatively subtle distinctions in the native experience of this remote region during Roman times.</p>

<p>The archive of the Rough Cilicia Survey Project consists of the <a href=""https://purr.purdue.edu/publications/2924"">RCSP Study Collection</a>, the <a href=""https://purr.purdue.edu/publications/3126"" target=""_blank"">RCSP Context Pottery</a>, <a href = ""https://purr.purdue.edu/publications/3535/1"">addenda and errata</a>, and the <a href=""https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/rcas/"" target=""_blank"">RCSP Annual Field Reports</a></p>

<p>During the course of thirteen field seasons (1996-2005, 2007-08, 2011) the RCSP survey team employed a multi-phased process of archaeological inspection that included pedestrian survey of urban and rural terrain, architectural mapping of surviving features, ceramics collections, geological survey, remote sensing of existing land cover, and maritime survey. All data was geo-referenced for mounting in project GIS.</p>

<p>The Project Director was Nicholas Rauh (Purdue University). The Field Directors were, in 1996-1997 Richard Blanton (Purdue University), in 1998-2002 Luann Wandsnider (U. of Nebraska at Lincoln), and from 2003-2011, Nicholas Rauh. The Architectural Mapping Team consisted of Rhys Townsend (Clark U.), Michael Hoff (U. Nebraska at Lincoln), and in 1996 Jennifer Tobin (U. Illinois at Chicago). The Geology Team included Sancar Ozaner (TUBITAK), Hulya Caner (U. of Istanbul), Timothy Filley (Purdue U.), Martin Doyle (Duke U.), Lawrence Theller (Purdue U.), and Unal Akkemik (U. of Istanbul). The Underwater Survey Team (2003-2004) was directed by Cheryl Ward (Florida State U.). The RCSP Pottery team consisted of Nicholas Rauh, Richard Rothaus (St. Cloud State U.), Matthew Dillon (Loyola Marymount U.), Caroline Autret (U.Paris-Sorbonne), and Asena Kizilarslanoglu (Kastamonu U.). Mette Korsholm (David Collection, Copenhagen) curated the project&rsquo;s small finds. Christopher Dore (U. of Arizona) and Edward Connor (Mass. Dept. of Water Conservation and Recreation) conducted remote sensing of existing land cover. Data Processing and assemblage of this archive was facilitated by Stanislav Pej&scaron;a (Purdue U.) and Maxwell Black (Camby IN). Scores of students have participated in the processing, photography, scanning, and illustration of this data, both in the field in Gazipaşa and at Purdue University.</p>

<p>The project was funded three times by the US National Science Foundation (1996, 2000, 2003), twice by the National Geographic Society (2004, 2011), once by the American Research Institute in Turkey (1999), and recurrently by participating universities.</p>","ancient greece, archaeological survey, archaeology, classical studies, pottery, rcsap, rcsp, rough cilicia, rough cilicia survey project, turkey","Caroline Autret, Hatice Kızılarslanoğlu, Matthew Dillon, Nicholas Kregotis Rauh, Stanislav Pejša"

The team extended the survey all the way to Antiochia ad Cragum; however, it has characterized remains further south as likely satellite settlements to the urban sites of Nephelion and Antiochia ad Cragum. The RCSP survey team first investigated the ridge in 1997, employing coarse interval survey techniques with minimal grab samples. The team returned to the Coastal Ridge in 1998 to conduct more exhaustive close-interval survey, while employing a combination of grab sampling techniques.</p>

The team&rsquo;s attention was drawn to this remote, mountainous region by the interest of the geological team, which was attempting to locate highland areas of old growth cedar forest close to the sea, and associated lowland areas of alluvial deposition. Ascending to the crest of Gurcam Karatepe Mountain, the team encountered the remains of a Roman era &ldquo;lumbering camp&rdquo; at 1600m elevation (RC 0305). On a bench below the mountain the team encountered the remains of a village settlement (RC 0306, Taşlı Seki). This site sits above the Karasın river basin that descends to the Kaledran River, above the mouth of which sits the ancient acropolis of Charadros (urban site, RC 0401). A third century AD inscription found near the ancient harbor of Charadros indicates that it served as the maritime depot to the Lamotis, that is, the regional territory of Lamos. Patches of ancient roads encountered by the team indicate a likely road network between Charadros and Lamos. Accordingly, the team conducted close-interval flag survey on the acropolis of Charadros in 2004, while the geological team excavated pollen trenches in the river basin below. The investigation of the region was limited by the need of the pedestrian team to work in close proximity to the geology team, as well as by the prohibitive terrain of the Kaledran river basin, where tall mountains descend to the shore, closing off access to remote interior highland basins. While pollen trench excavations were underway, the team conducted minimal prospective survey in the immediate vicinity, encountering a monumental village with possible temple remains at Hisar Asarı (RC 0405), but otherwise finding small isolated remains (RC 0402-0404, 0414). Later, the team was directed by Turkish forestry officials to a Roman era fortress (RC 0409, Frengez Kale), and a monumental village (RC 0410, G&ouml;kcebelen Kale) along the upper reaches of the Karasın tributary.

Despite repeated investigations through the years, the site has failed to reveal the necessary consistency of ceramic forms to warrant identification as a kiln site, despite fines of over-fired ceramic remains and kiln lining. The site most likely functioned as a Late Roman maritime depot. Further up river the team encountered sherd scatters and structural remains (RC 9808-9812) on a low promontory above the river bed in 1998. In 1999, the team employed close-interval survey combined with grab collections within a 20m radius to inspect the entire length of a ridge north of the river (Kahyalar). At the crest of the ridge, the team encountered the monumental village site of Nergis Tepe (RC 9902). Descending the arms of the ridge, the team encountered numerous sherd scatters and isolated structural remains (RC 9904-9916). In 2002 the team employed close-interval flag survey to investigate a large cluster of press installations on the nearby promontory of Kale Tepe (RC 0201). Hellenistic finds, including a stamped Knidian amphora handle, indicate that the site was occupied prior to the Roman era.</p>

The challenges of the rugged highland landscape and the need to coordinate activities with the work of the geological team constrained the ability of the survey team to investigate large tracts of terrain. During the 2003 season the team was directed by soldiers at the Karatepe Jandarma Station to five ancient sites in the highland basin of the Bi&ccedil;kici River (elevation 800-1200m). These include RC 0301 Sivaste (urban site), RC 0302 Akkaya Mahhale (Roman road settlement), RC 0303 Kara&ccedil;ukur (pre-Classical settlement), RC 0304 Kenetepe (urban site), and RC 0309 Ilica Kale (monumental village). The team conducted close-interval flag survey and detailed architectural recording at all five sites. It encountered one additional fortified site (RC 0308, Kilise Taş Mevkii) while investigating the crest of the mountain (Kara Dağı) that looms above the basin. In 2007, while excavating a pollen trench at Sugozu Yayla at the crest of the Bi&ccedil;kici Canyon (1687m elevation), the team encountered sherd scatters in the immediate vicinity (RC 0701, 0702). In 2008, the team conducted off-site, close-interval flag survey in the terraced fields that extend between RC 0301 Sivaste and RC 0304 Kenetepe. In the process the team identified additional sherd scatters (RC 0801, 0803), and most importantly, it encountered a lithic production center (possibly Chalcolithic) at Sivritaş Tepe (RC 0802). During the final survey season in 2011, the team concentrated its efforts on pollen trench excavations at the crest of the Taşeli Plateau, that is, the yayla district above the Bi&ccedil;kici Canyon (above 1500m elevation). Brief pedestrian surveys employing close interval flag survey techniques in the immediate vicinity of the trenches revealed a Pre-Pottery Neolithic production center for polished beads at Gunnercik Yayla (RC 1101) and a Hellenistic-Early Roman era settlement at Sugozu Yayla (RC 1102) and a small isolated settlement at Beobaşı (RC 1103). Seeking locations to Isaurian-styled cemeteries similar to the one found at RC 0304 Kenetepe, the team was directed by a retired Turkish Forestry worker to fairly distant sites at Armutlar Mevkii (RC 1104, isolated settlement) and &Ccedil;oruş (RC 1105, monumental village). Although architecturally significant, neither site furnished significant ceramic remains.</p>

The results of this study demonstrated that non-dimensional parameters, such as OSI, were more robust to varying modalities and spatial resolutions and thus may provide more robust risk or growth and rupture assessments.

Authorized by the Turkish General Directorate of Cultural Heritage and Museums, the RCSP successfully conducted thirteen field seasons between 1996 and 2011 (1996-2005, 2007-2008, 2011). Employing methods common to landscape archaeology, the team attempted to record ceramic, architectural, current land cover, and geological data to contextualize settlement development in western Rough Cilicia (modern Gazipasha) from the Neolithic through the Byzantine eras. This dataset focuses on the results of the ceramic research of the RCSP pedestrian survey. The pedestrian survey strategically targeted four distinct landscape regions in the survey area. These include the urban sites, river basins, and ridges along the coast (Coastal Region, 1996-1999); the interior canyons of the &ldquo;Mesogeia&rdquo; (Adanda Canyon and Kaledran Basin, 2000-2004); the highland settlements just below the crest of the Tauros Mts. (Bickici Highland, 2003, 2007-2008); and the yayla settlements at the top of the mountains (Taşeli Plateau, 2011). In all, some 1000 hectares of Rough Cilician rural terrain were investigated, some 160 &ldquo;sites&rdquo; were inspected, and some 9400 fragments of pottery were processed and recorded. This dataset contains the metadata for all sites and datasets in one spreadsheet. We present this spreadsheet to facilitate quantitative and qualitative analyses.

Greater knowledge of factors that influence crop growth and development is required to improve the breeding development pipeline for energy crops. Genomics tools have advanced and the pace of genotyping has accelerated exponentially while the cost of sequencing has dramatically decreased. The bottleneck has thus shifted emphasis from understanding the genotype to understanding the phenotype.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recent technological advancements in remote sensing have made it possible to extract massive volumes of morphological, physiological, and agronomic data from bioenergy crops, but complexities in data processing, feature extraction, and data analytics make predictions of crop performance from remote sensing data a challenge. Plant phenotyping pipelines for measuring and predicting plant productivity and performance from remotely sensed data are needed. These may include both ground-based and airborne sensor platforms for high-throughput phenotyping. High-throughput phenotyping data can be matched with genetic data through complex analytics to enable optimization of sorghum for biomass and energy yield for transportation fuel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The purpose of this project was to develop a disruptive technology system based on airborne and ground-based mobile sensor systems, confirmed by handheld sensors and agronomic&nbsp;performance data that enables phenotyping of sorghum for biomass and energy yield for transportation fuel. We achieved the goals of the project with key successes in (1) optimizing high-throughput remote-sensing technologies to acquire relevant data on sorghum plant phenotypes, (2) implementation of data analytics algorithms for segmentation and feature extraction, (3) developing predictive models for plant growth and performance, and (4) designing and implementing genetic analysis pipelines to identify genes controlling sorghum performance; and (5) designing a user-friendly system platform to enable breeders and other end users to interact with the needed data and analytics.</p>

This is a dataset comprised of videos and raw load-displacement text files of experiments run to demonstrate the use of in situ TEM mechanical testing to find meaningful mechanical properties of as received, self-ion, and proton irradiated Fe-9%Cr ODS. The desire to work at small scale in characterization of irradiated materials to reduce costs and improve throughput, require the development of novel methods to assess mechanical properties in volume-limited irradiation damage layers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this work micropillar compression (archived separately), cantilever bending, lamellae indentation, and clamped beam fracture testing is conducted on ion-irradiated Fe-9%Cr ODS to find yield stress, elastic modulus, flow stress, and fracture toughness. Micropillars in compression allow us to define a minimum sample dimension, which approaches the obstacle spacing of the material, at which size effects are observed. This relationship between sample dimension and obstacle spacing defined through micropillar compression is extended to a new testing geometry, cantilever bending, and material property, flow stress. Lessons learned during the cantilever bending informed the clamped beam design for conducting fracture testing on a ductile engineering alloy at micrometer scales. Finally, lamellae indentation was conducted to link qualitative observations of the microstructure under load with literature strength of obstacle values. By combining an understanding of the microstructure of irradiated Fe-9%Cr ODS and the in situ TEM technique, one can find the bulk-like mechanical properties of ion irradiated Fe-9%Cr ODS.</p>

	<li>Predators and pathogens are fundamental components of ecological communities that have the potential to influence each other via their interactions with victims and to initiate density- and trait-mediated effects, including trophic cascades. Despite this, experimental tests of the healthy herds hypothesis, wherein predators influence pathogen transmission, are rare. Moreover, no studies have separated effects mediated by density vs. traits. Using a semi-natural mesocosm experiment, we investigated the interactive effects of predatory dragonfly larvae (caged or lethal [free-ranging]) and a viral pathogen, ranavirus, on larval amphibians (gray treefrogs and northern leopard frogs).</li>
	<li>We determined the influence of predators on ranavirus transmission and the relative importance of density- and trait-mediated effects on observed patterns. Lethal predators reduced ranavirus infection prevalence by 57&ndash;83% compared to no-predator and caged-predator treatments. The healthy-herds effect was more strongly associated with reductions in tadpole density than behavioral responses to predators.</li>
	<li>We also assessed whether ranavirus altered the responses of tadpoles to predators. In the absence of virus, tadpoles reduced activity levels and developed deeper tails in the presence of predators. However, there was no evidence that virus presence or infection altered responses to predators.</li>
	<li>Finally, we compared the magnitude of trophic cascades initiated by individual and combined natural enemies. Lethal predators initiated a trophic cascade by reducing tadpole density, but caged predators and ranavirus did not. The absence of a virus-induced trophic cascades is ostensibly the consequence of limited virus-induced mortality and the ability of infected individuals to continue interacting with the community.</li>
	<li>Our results provide support for the healthy herds hypothesis in amphibian communities. We uniquely demonstrate that density-mediated effects of predators outweigh trait-mediated effects in driving this pattern. Moreover, this study was one of the first to directly compare trophic cascades caused by predators and pathogens. Our results underscore the importance of examining the interactions between predators and pathogens in ecology.</li>

<p>These videos accompany a dissertation describing recent advancements in micro-mechanical testing that inform how deformation mechanisms in 304L stainless steels (SS) are affected by the presence of irradiation-induced defects. Austenitic 304L SS is one of the most widely utilized structural alloys in nuclear energy systems, but the role of irradiation on its underlying mechanisms of mechanical deformation remains relatively poorly understood. Now, recent advancement of micro-scale mechanical testing in a scanning electron microscope (SEM), coupled with site-specific transmission electron microscopy (TEM), enables us to precisely determine deformation mechanisms as a function of plastic strain and grain orientation.</p>

<p>We focus on AISI 304L stainless steel irradiated in EBR-II to 20 displacements per atom (dpa) at 415&deg;C, and contains ~3 atomic parts per million (appm) He amounting to 1.5% swelling.&nbsp; A portion of the specimen is laser welded in-hot cell; the laser weld heat affected zone (HAZ) is studied and considered to have undergone post-irradiation annealing (PIA). An archival, virgin specimen is also studied as a control.&nbsp; We conduct nanoindentation then prepare TEM lamellae from the indent plastic zone. TEM investigation reveals nucleation of deformation-induced <em>&alpha;</em>&rsquo; martensite in the irradiated specimen, and metastable <em>&epsilon;</em> martensite in the PIA specimen. Meanwhile, the unirradiated control specimen exhibits evidence only of dislocation slip and twinning; this is unsurprising given that alternative deformation mechanisms such as twinning and martensitic transformation are typically observed only near cryogenic temperatures in austenitic SS. Surface area of irradiation-produced cavities contribute sufficient free energy to accommodate the martensitic transformation. The lower population of cavities in the PIA material enables <em>&epsilon;</em> martensite formation, while the higher cavity number density in the irradiated material causes <em>&alpha;</em>&rsquo; martensite fromation. SEM-based micropillar compression tests confirm nanoindentation results. Irradiation damage could enable fundamental, mechanistic studies of deformation mechanisms that are typically only accessible at extremely low temperatures.</p>","dissertation, in situ, lasers, materials engineering, mechanical testing, micropillar, nuclear engineering, transformation","Keyou Mao, Keyou Keyou"

To measure N<sub>2</sub>O/CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations accurately, we developed a quantitative method of N<sub>2</sub>O/CO<sub>2</sub> analysis that minimized interferences from diurnal changes of humidity and temperature. Two chemometric multivariate models: classical least squares (CLS) and partial least squares (PLS), were developed. This study evaluated various methods to generate the single beam background spectra, and different spectral regions for determining N<sub>2</sub>O/CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations from OP-FTIR spectra. A standard extractive method was used to measure the &lsquo;actual&rsquo; path-averaged concentrations along an OP-FTIR optical path in situ, as a benchmark to assess the feasibilities of these quantitative methods. Within an absolute humidity range of 5,000-20,000 ppmv and a temperature range of 10-35 &deg;C, we found that the CLS model underestimated N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations (bias = -4.9&plusmn;3.1 %) calculated from OP-FTIR spectra, and the PLS model improved the accuracy of calculated N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations (bias = 1.4&plusmn;2.3 %). The bias of calculated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations was -1.0&plusmn;2.8 % using the CLS model. These methods suggested that environmental variables potentially lead to biases in N<sub>2</sub>O/CO<sub>2</sub> estimations from OP-FTIR spectra and may help OP-FTIR users avoid dependency on extractive methods of calibrations.</p>

<p>We use H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>v</sub> isotopic vertical profile measurements and complementary meteorological observations to examine how boundary layer, cloud, and mixing processes influence the vertical structure of deuterium-excess (d-excess&thinsp;=&thinsp;&delta;D&thinsp;&ndash;&thinsp;8&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;&delta;<sup>18</sup>O) in the boundary layer, inversion layer, and lower free troposphere. Airborne measurements of water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>v</sub>) stable isotopologues were conducted around two continental U.S. cities in February&ndash;March 2016. Nine research flights were designed to characterize the &delta;D, &delta;<sup>18</sup>O, and d-excess vertical profiles extending from the surface to &le;&thinsp;2&thinsp;km. We examine observations from three unique case study flights in detail. One case study shows H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>v</sub> isotopologue vertical profiles that are consistent with Rayleigh isotopic distillation theory coinciding with clear skies, dry adiabatic lapse rates within the boundary layer, and relatively constant vertical profiles of wind speed and wind direction. The two remaining case studies show that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>v</sub> isotopic signatures above the boundary layer are sensitive to cloud processes and complex air mass mixing patterns. These two case studies indicate anomalies in the d-excess signature relative to Rayleigh theory, such as low d-excess values at the interface of the inversion layer and the free troposphere, which is possibly indicative of cloud evaporation.

<p>Forest ecosystems have been impacted by climate change, resulting in species-level tree migration.&nbsp; However, little is known about climate change impacts at the community level.&nbsp; Here, we assess changes to forest communities at three scales: within community changes in species composition, individual community spatial shifts, and changes across all communities.</p>

<p><strong>Location</strong></p>

<p>Eastern United States</p>

<p><strong>Major taxa studied</strong></p>

<p>Forest tree species</p>

<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>

<p>Using a region-wide forest inventory dataset from the USDA Forest Service&rsquo;s Forest Inventory and Analysis Program with over 70,000 plots, we identified forest communities using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation method. We analyzed species composition changes within communities and assessed community-level spatial shifts over the last three decades to quantify individual community responses to climate change.&nbsp; We utilized the distribution of forest communities across historic climate conditions to predict where the communities could migrate during the study period and compared climate-predicted shifts to observed community shifts.&nbsp; Changes across all communities were modeled as a function of climate and non-climate variables using generalized linear mixed-effects models.</p>

<p><strong>Results</strong></p>

<p>We identified 12 regional forest communities of the eastern United States, which varied in their stability of species composition over the study period. All communities experienced a relatively short yet significant shift in their spatial distribution (median = 8.0 km dec<sup>-1</sup>).&nbsp; Historic climate and changes in seasonal temperature variability were the best predictors of change across all communities. However, the distance and direction of individual community migration was poorly predicted by climate change, and the observed direction was often opposite of the predicted direction.</p>

<p><strong>Main conclusions</strong></p>

<p>Forest communities shifted their distributions over the last three decades, but climate change outpaced the rate of community migration.&nbsp; Slow responses to climate change may indicate lags between climate change and responses of forest communities, leading to the inability to change at a rate commensurate with changing climate.</p>","climate change, forest inventory and analysis, forestry and natural resources, latent dirichlet allocation, regional forest communities, spatial shifts, tree migration","Michael A.

Whole genome re-sequencing of sorghum EMS mutants exhibiting an alkali spreading value (ASV) phenotype revealed candidate SNPs in <em>Sobic.004G163700</em> and <em>Sobic.010G093400</em>. Comparative genomics identified <em>Sobic.010G093400</em> as a <em>starch synthase IIa</em> and <em>Sobic.004G163700</em> as a <em>starch branching enzyme IIb</em>. Segregation analyses showed that mutations in <em>Sobic.010G093400</em> or <em>Sobic.004G163700</em> co-segregated with the ASV phenotype. Mutants in <em>SSIIa</em> exhibited no change in amylose content but expressed lower final viscosity and lower starch gelatinization temperature (GT) than starches from non-mutant plants. The <em>sbeIIb</em> mutants exhibited significantly higher amylose levels and starch GT and lower viscosity compared to non-mutant starches and <em>ssIIa</em> mutants. Mutations in <em>SBEIIb</em> had a dosage dependent effect on amylose content. Double mutants of <em>sbeIIb</em> and <em>ssIIa</em> resembled their <em>sbeIIb</em> parent in amylose content, starch thermal properties and viscosity profiles. These variants will provide opportunities to produce sorghum varieties with modified starch end-use qualities important for the beer brewing and baking industries and specialty foods for humans with diabetes.</p>

Our objective was to determine if lipid profiles of vaginal swabs were different between gilts suckled by sow or fed milk replacer the first 48 h postpartum, with and without a lard-based fat supplement. Gilts (&gt;1.3 kg) were selected at birth across 8 litters and assigned to treatments: colostrum suckled (S, n=8); S plus fat supplement (SF, n=5); bottle-fed milk replacer (B, n=8); or B plus fat supplement (BF, n=7). At 48 h postnatal, vaginal swabs were taken with a cytology brush, immersed in ultrapure water to burst cells, and lipids extracted for analysis using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-profiling. Lipids extracted from serum collected at 48 h from gilts and milk collected from sows at 24 h were also analyzed with MRM-profiling. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis found 18 lipids highly distinguished [area-under-the-curve (AUC) &gt; 0.9] between S and B gilts, including phosphatidylethanolamine with 34 carbon and four unsaturations in the fatty acyl residues [PE(34:4)]. Twelve lipids from vaginal swabs highly correlated (r &gt; 0.6; p &lt; 0.01) with nutrition source. Lipids more abundant in milk replacer drove association.

<p>Object signatures have been widely used in object detection and classification. Following a similar idea, the authors developed geometric signatures for architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) objects such as footings, slabs, walls, beams, and columns. The signatures were developed both scientifically and empirically, by following a data-driven approach based on analysis of collected building information modeling (BIM) data using geometric theories. Rigorous geometric properties and statistical information were included in the developed geometric signatures. To enable an open access to BIM data using these signatures, the authors also initiated a BIM data repository with a preliminary collection of AEC objects and their geometric signatures. The developed geometric signatures were preliminarily tested by a small object classification experiment where 389 object instances from an architectural model were used. A rule-based algorithm developed using all parameter values of 14 features from the geometric signatures of the objects successfully classified 336 object instances into the correct categories of beams, columns, slabs, and walls. This higher than 85% accuracy showed the developed geometric signatures are promising. The collected and processed data were deposited into the Purdue University Research Repository (PURR) for sharing.</p>

The descriptions often contain the mental soil landscape models used by the original soil surveyor(s) and were extracted from both the Busia soil survey report and soil class descriptions from the legend of the Soil Map of the World (FAO/UNESCO, 1974) and quantified by a set of rules. Second, a digital model must be developed that represents the landscape and environmental conditions of the original landscape. Environmental conditions of the study area were captured using six terrain attributes derived from a 30 m digital elevation model (DEM) in SAGA-GIS and parent material map extracted from the soil polygon map were used.

Thus, typically it takes a raster-based approach which means that it divides the area to be mapped into small pixels and determines the soil type for each pixel.&nbsp;Soil at each pixel is expressed in terms of its similarity to a set of prescribed soil types often referred to as &lsquo;fuzzy soil mapping&rsquo;. To avoid assigning a single soil type to a given location, similarity values (fuzzy membership values) are assigned to each soil type expressing the similarity of the local soil to each of the prescribed soil types. One must therefore know the types of soil existing in the area to be mapped. Soil types at a given location are predicted using the similarity values by assessing the environmental conditions at the location according to knowledge on how these conditions are related to the development of each soil type. Similarity values are generated by calculation the zonal statistics for each cluster in SAGA-GIS to obtain the range of values for each environmental covariate. The two key inputs to SoLIM are: data on the selected environmental covariates related to soil conditions in the area, and knowledge that describes the relationships between soils and the environmental variables.</p>","agronomy, busia area, digital soil mapping, fuzzy membership values, geographic information systems (gis), kenya, solim","Darrell Schulze, Joshua Minai, Joshua O Minai"

Single characteristics are therefore grouped into a combination called land quality, which can be used as an independent diagnostic criterion reflecting limitations for land use. It can be quantified and rated and then used to specify criteria or suitability class units. The Kenya soil survey prepared proposals for the rating of the land qualities, which are laid in the Internal Communications Nos. 7 and 29 (Kenya Soil Survey, 1977 and 1988 respectively). Land qualities are classified into three to five grades ranging from very high to very low.

<p>Methane emissions from organic-rich soils in the Arctic have been extensively studied due to their potential to increase the atmospheric methane burden as permafrost thaws. However, this methane source might have been overestimated without considering high affinity methanotrophs (HAM, methane oxidizing bacteria) recently identified in Arctic mineral soils. Here, we find that HAM dynamics double the upland methane sink (~5.5 TgCH<sub>4</sub>yr<sup>-1</sup>) north of 50&deg;N in simulations from 2000-2016 by integrating the dynamics of HAM and methanogens into a biogeochemistry model&nbsp;that includes permafrost SOC dynamics. The increase is equivalent to at least half of the difference in net methane emissions estimated between process-based models and observation-based inversions, and the revised estimates better match site-level and regional observations. The new model projects doubled wetland methane emissions between 2017-2100 due to more accessible permafrost carbon. However, most of the increase in wetland emissions is offset by a concordant increase in the upland sink, leading to only an 18% increase in net methane emission (from 29 to 35 TgCH<sub>4</sub>yr<sup>-1</sup>).

</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are three additional modules that cover standard OSHA regulations and standalone scenarios:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Introduction</strong> is the official OSHA disclaimers and information regarding the Grant that funded the project</li>
	<li><strong>Jobsite Tour</strong> is a passive experience that takes the user through various points of the environment, where they are free to look around the observe without needing to listen to or follow instruction</li>
	<li><strong>Fall Scenario</strong> is a &ldquo;highly-interactive&rdquo; module that puts the user in the event of a fall. The user is tasked with choosing the correct equipment from a series of options that will protect a fellow worker from falling off a tall building, thereby saving his life. Once the user has chosen all the necessary equipment, the worker falls and the user is told while choices they made were correct. If any of the choices were incorrect, the user is free to run through the module again until they have chosen correctly for each piece of equipment</li>

			<p>Biodiversity is assumed to be critical for ecosystem functions, but the ability for existing biodiversity measures to accurately predict ecosystem functions remains uncertain.&nbsp;To improve the accuracy of ecosystem function predictions, we propose a new vector of biodiversity metrics, structural diversity, that have the potential to better predict ecosystem functions at large spatial scales. Using lidar-derived canopy structural diversity metrics on 19 forested sites from the National Ecological Observation Network across the USA, we show that a set of proposed structural diversity metrics are better at predicting 50% of key ecosystem functions than current biodiversity measures of species richness and phylogenetic diversity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Objective: The objective of this study was to identify potential needs and barriers related to using exoskeletons to decrease musculoskeletal (MS) symptoms for workers in the operating room (OR).</p>

<p>Background: MS symptoms and injuries adversely impact worker health and performance in surgical environments. Half of the surgical team members (e.g., surgeons, nurses, trainees) report MS symptoms during and after surgery. Although the ergonomic risks in surgery are well recognized, little has been done to develop and sustain effective interventions.</p>

<p>Method: Surgical team members (n = 14) participated in focus groups, performed a 10-min simulated surgical task with a commercial upper-body exoskeleton, and then completed a usability questionnaire. Content analysis was conducted to determine relevant themes.</p>

<p>Results: Four themes were identified: (1) characteristics of individuals, (2) perceived benefits, (3) environmental/societal factors, and (4) intervention characteristics. Participants noted that exoskeletons would benefit workers who stand in prolonged, static postures (e.g., holding instruments for visualization) and indicated that they could foresee a long-term decrease in MS symptoms with the intervention. Specifically, raising awareness of exoskeletons for early-career workers and obtaining buy-in from team members may increase future adoption of this technology. Mean participant responses from the System Usability Scale was 81.3 out of 100 (SD = 8.1), which was in the acceptable range of usability.</p>

<p>Conclusion: Adoption factors were identified to implement exoskeletons in the OR, such as the indicated need for exoskeletons and usability. Exoskeletons may be beneficial in the OR, but barriers such as maintenance and safety to adoption will need to be addressed.</p>

"2395","3319","10.4231/ZAD3-MG98","HTP-Soy: An Aerial Image Set of Multi-category Soybean for High-Throughput Phenotyping (HTP)","The publication “HTP-Soy” contains 1,728 aerial images of soybean plots in the field and each image is categorized based on spatial, temporal, and genetic variations.  Data is made available to encourage development of HTP applications.","<p dir=""ltr"">Using high-throughput data collection and analysis, High-Throughput Phenotyping (HTP) studies plant phenotypic traits and their interactions with Genotype, Environment, and Management (GxExM). Recently, HTP has empowered cross-cutting applications in agronomy such as plant breeding (Xavier et al., 2017), yield prediction (Hassan et al., 2019), and stress evaluation (Lyu et al., 2019). Furthermore, with food production under increased stress from growing populations and climate uncertainty, HTP can provide a cheaper and faster solution to secure global food production.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Modern HTP has&nbsp;been evolving toward image-based and learning-based approaches, but publicly available image sets are scarce, in particular aerial image sets of plants in the field. Previously released image sets are restricted to either species level such as trees (Kumar et al., 2012) and vegetables (Zheng et al., 2019), or experiment environment such as greenhouse and stationary camera (e.g., Cruz et al., 2016; Das Choudhury et al., 2018, Taghavi Namin et al., 2018). However, emerging HTP approaches have shown increasing interest in finer grained plant images at sub-species or genetic level, as well as more versatile experiment environments that can simulate plant growth in practice. For example, one of the emerging approaches is to plant crop plots with different genetics in the field and capture their images by using Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)&nbsp; (Lyu et al., 2019). This approach allows us to scale up HTP for massive crop plots at very high spatial and temporal resolutions, while raising new challenges such as accurate crop plot localization, efficient Vegetation Index computation, and unbiased modelling under spatial/temporal/genetic variations.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we have assembled an image set called &ldquo;HTP-Soy&rdquo;, which contains 1,728 aerial images of soybean plots in the field. Specifically, these images represent 96 soybean plots at 3 growth stages, and for each soybean plot at each growth stage there are 6 image replicates from different camera view angles. Each neighbor of 6 soybean plots share the same genetics. Therefore, each image is categorized based on spatial, temporal, and genetic variations. We collected these images by using an eBee UAS from senseFly which flew over a soybean field in Romney, Indiana on July 2, July 6, and July 12, 2018, respectively. We flew the UAS at a height of 120 meters and the UAS had a high-resolution senseFly S.O.D.A. RGB camera onboard, which produced images at a Ground Sampling Distance of 2.5 cm. Besides, we flew the UAS with a forward and side overlap ratio of over 85% and 75%, which provided multiple image replicates at different camera view angles. Having the raw UAS images, we extracted all soybean plot images automatically using the approach of Hearst et al. (in review) and Lyu et al. (2019). Before publication, manual verification and adjustments were also deployed.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The HTP-Soy image set is publicly available from the Purdue University Research Repository (PURR). It can be downloaded as a compressed file &ldquo;HTP-Soy.zip.&rdquo; Inside &ldquo;HTP-Soy.zip&rdquo;, the &ldquo;original&rdquo; folder contains the original 1,728 aerial images of soybean plots in the field, the &ldquo;segmented&rdquo; folder contains another version of these 1,728 images with canopy segmented, and the other three image files that describe the experiment site at three growth stages. Inside each folder, images are grouped into three sub-folders based on their growth stages. For each image, its naming convention follows the format of &ldquo;<growth stage=""""> - row - <row> - range - <range> - u - <unit> - rep - <replicate>&rdquo;: Each token of &ldquo;<growth stage="""">&rdquo; denotes a growth stage;&nbsp; each token combo of &ldquo;row - <row> - range - <range>&rdquo; denotes a unique genetics; each token combo of &ldquo;row - <row> - range - <range> - u - <unit>&rdquo; denotes a unique soybean plot in the field; and each token of &ldquo;rep - <replicate>&rdquo; denotes a camera view angle.&nbsp;</replicate></unit></range></row></range></row></growth></replicate></unit></range></row></growth></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">We hope HTP-Soy can benefit research in HTP and other related communities such as agronomy and computer science. For future research using HTP, we envision several applications including: 1) a benchmark dataset to train and test classification algorithms on crop plot images, 2) a baseline dataset to explore the effect of spatial, temporal, and genetic variations on HTP models, and 3) an introduction dataset to help visualize crop plots in the field from the perspective of UAS.&nbsp;</p>

Using this finding as the motivation, this study examines the changes in model simulated cloud properties in response to redistributing the aerosol profiles over the ocean. Ten years (2006-15) of CALIOP retrieved smoke aerosol extinction profiles were used to redistribute the model simulated aerosol mass on a monthly mean basis, keeping the column aerosol mass conserved. The results from the model sensitivity experiments show that elevating the aerosol layer to higher levels in agreement with the observations causes an increase in cloud fractions by ~33% for shallow marine boundary layers (MBL), while cloud fractions decrease by ~30% for deeper MBL. We found that aerosol-induced warming within the shallow MBL cloud layers leads to reduced cloud presence due to decrease in relative humidity at these levels. For deeper MBL, increased MBL stability in the lower altitude aerosol case compared to the elevated aerosol layer case suppresses the cloud vertical extent, enhances the cloud cover and delays the stratocumulus to cumulus transition. Finally, aerosol redistribution impacts on radiative forcing are investigated, which appear to be mainly driven by the changes in cloud area fractions rather than in-cloud LWP changes between the model experiments.</p>","aerosols, atlantic ocean, climate, clouds, earth and atmospheric sciences, gcm, nasa","Sampa Das, Sandi L Caldrone, H.

<p>The data provided in this publication was used to evaluate parameters including wall shear stress (WSS), oscillatory shear index (OSI), and relative residence times (RRT) across multiple modalities and two patient-specific aneurysm geometries. Specifically, the assumptions and limitations of each modality coupled with the varying and often low spatial resolution and their subsequent effect on the hemodynamic metrics was explored. The results of this study demonstrated that non-dimensional parameters, such as OSI, were more robust to varying modalities and spatial resolutions and thus may provide more robust risk or growth and rupture assessments. These results demonstrate a need for further investigation and development of non-dimensional parameters and correlation of such parameters to risk of aneurysm.</p>

<p>Additionally, the pulsatile particle velocimetry results provided here can be used as robust validation test cases for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers.</p>

<p>These data files were created using Matlab 2016.</p>

<p>Previous evaluations of simulated aerosol transport over the South-east Atlantic by global aerosol models, including Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) Atmospheric GCM, showed that the bulk of the modeled smoke aerosol layer resided ~1-2 km lower than CALIOP lidar observations over the ocean. Using this finding as the motivation, this study examines the changes in model simulated cloud properties in response to redistributing the aerosol profiles over the ocean. Ten years (2006-15) of CALIOP retrieved smoke aerosol extinction profiles were used to redistribute the model simulated aerosol mass on a monthly mean basis, keeping the column aerosol mass conserved. The results from the model sensitivity experiments show that elevating the aerosol layer to higher levels in agreement with the observations causes an increase in cloud fractions by ~33% for shallow marine boundary layers (MBL), while cloud fractions decrease by ~30% for deeper MBL. We found that aerosol-induced warming within the shallow MBL cloud layers leads to reduced cloud presence due to decrease in relative humidity at these levels. For deeper MBL, increased MBL stability in the lower altitude aerosol case compared to the elevated aerosol layer case suppresses the cloud vertical extent, enhances the cloud cover and delays the stratocumulus to cumulus transition.

This study provides a modeling framework to adequately quantify the Arctic land ecosystem carbon budget by considering the lateral transport of carbon affected by permafrost...","<p>Arctic terrestrial ecosystems are very sensitive to the global climate change due to the large storage of soil organic carbon and the presence of snow, glacier and permafrost, which respond directly to near surface air temperature that has warmed in the Arctic by almost twice as much as the global average. These ecosystems play a significant role in affecting regional and global carbon cycling, which have been traditionally quantified using biogeochemical models that have not explicitly considered the loss of carbon due to lateral flow of water from land to aquatic ecosystems. &nbsp;Building upon an extant spatially-distributed hydrological model and a process-based biogeochemical model, we have developed a three-dimensional terrestrial ecosystem model (ECO3D) to elucidate how lateral water flow has impacted the regional dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics in the Tanana Flats Basin in central Alaska.&nbsp; The model explicitly simulates the production, consumption and transport of DOC. Both <i>in-situ</i> observational data and remote sensing-based products were used to calibrate and validate the model. Our simulations show that: (1) plant-litter DOC leaching exerts significant controls on soil DOC concentration during precipitation and snowmelt events; (2) lateral transport plays an important role in affecting regional DOC dynamics; and (3) DOC export to the Tanana River is approximately 9.6 &times; 10<sup>6</sup> kg C yr<sup>-1</sup>. This study provides a modeling framework to adequately quantify the Arctic land ecosystem carbon budget by considering the lateral transport of carbon affected by permafrost degradation. The quantification of the lateral carbon fluxes will also improve future carbon cycle modeling for Arctic aquatic ecosystems.</p>","alaska, arctic region, biogeochemistry, c, carbon cycle, climate change, earth and atmospheric sciences, eco3d, ecosystem, hydrology, lsm, permafrost, tem","Ruby Leung, Laodong Guo, Chang Liao, Qianlai Zhuang, Sandi L Caldrone"

More robust rest-activity rhythms during G32 were positively (<em>p</em>=0.003) associated with gestational age of infant at birth.&nbsp; Time of cortisol peak (acrophase) during G22 was related with acrophase of activity (<em>r</em>=0.66; <em>p</em> = 0.001) and blood glucose levels (<em>r</em>= 0.58; <em>p</em>=0.006).&nbsp; During G22, minutes of wake after sleep onset was positively related to cortisol mesor and AUC (<em>p </em>&lt;0.05). Across all three time points <em>r</em>24 of activity was related with cortisol amplitude (<em>r</em>=0.33; <em>p</em>=0.01). The association of less robust activity rhythms with earlier gestational age of infant at birth supports the potential that circadian system disruption is linked to maternal-fetal health outcomes.

However, most studies are conducted under artificial conditions that are not representative of environmental exposures. Environmental exposures are characterized by multiple routes of exposure, low aquatic PFAS levels, and greater environmental variability than laboratory tests. Determining whether these factors influence toxicity is critical for understanding the effects of PFAS on aquatic life, including amphibians. Our goal was to assess the impact of PFAS on an amphibian under semi-realistic conditions. We reared northern leopard frog (<em>Rana pipiens</em>) larvae in outdoor mesocosms containing sediment spiked to low, medium, and high levels (nominally 10, 100, or 1000 ppb dw) of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) or perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) for 30 days. Larvae in all PFOS treatments and the medium-PFOA treatment were ~1.5 Gosner stages less developed than control animals after 30 days. Notably, these developmental delays were observed at PFOS concentrations in the water as low as 0.06 ppb, which is considerably lower than levels associated with developmental effects in laboratory studies. Our results suggest that deriving toxicity values from laboratory studies examining aquatic exposure only may underestimate the effects of environmental PFAS exposure.&nbsp;</p>","amphibian, aquatic toxicology, bioaccumulation, forestry and natural resources, multiple exposure routes, pfoa, pfos","Wes Flynn, Chloe de Perre, Linda Lee, Mike Iacchetta, Jason T.

<p>1. Non-native insects pose threats to forest health and often spread via stratified dispersal in which long-distance jumps cause elevated rates of range expansion. Quantifying patterns and developing models of spread is central to understanding drivers of invasion and forecasting future invasions.</p>

<p>2. We investigated the utility of models for characterizing and predicting spread of emerald ash borer (EAB), quantified temporal dynamics of spread, and identified correlates of county-level invasion risk.</p>

<p>3. We estimated rates and frequency of EAB spread and length of long-distance jumps throughout the contiguous USA from 1997-2018 and compared observed patterns with model predictions. A time-to-event model was then developed at the county-level to assess the influence of habitat characteristics and propagule pressure on invasion risk. The final model was used to forecast invasion risk across the contiguous USA.</p>

<p>4. Range expansion by EAB accorded well with model predictions. Following the initial establishment phase, range expansion rates were biphasic, shifting to a faster, linear pattern around 2002 and then declining from 2015 onwards. From 2003 onwards, EAB invaded 6 &ndash; 134 new counties per year, including a mean of 14 discrete jumps per year averaging 93 &plusmn; 7 SE km.</p>

<p>5. Risk of spread was positively associated with proximity to previously invaded areas, human population density, and densities of ash and non-ash forest trees but negatively associated with temperature.</p>

<p><em>Synthesis and applications </em>At the regional level, the invasion by EAB appears to be entering the saturation phase, indicating that most high-risk counties in the eastern USA have been invaded. Even though spread has recently slowed, counties in close proximity to invaded areas and that have high densities of humans and trees are at the greatest risk of becoming invaded. Taken together, our findings provide insight into historical and future dynamics of range expansion by EAB, which can be used to guide risk assessments for potential invaders capable of frequent long-distance dispersal</p>","agrilus, forestry and natural resources, fraxinus, insect, non-native, planipennis, spread","Samuel Ward, Songlin Fei, Andrew Liebhold"

<p>Lakes account for about 10% of the boreal landscape and are responsible for approximately 30% of biogenic methane emissions that have been found to increase under changing climate. However, the quantification of this climate-sensitive methane source is fraught with large uncertainty under warming climate conditions. Only a few studies have addressed the mechanism of climate impact on the increase of northern lake methane emissions. This study uses a large observational dataset of lake methane concentrations in Finland to constrain methane emissions with an extant process-based lake biogeochemical model. We found that the total current diffusive emission from Finnish lakes is 0.12&plusmn;0.03 Tg CH<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;yr<sup>-1</sup>&nbsp;and will increase by 26-59% by the end of this century depending on different warming scenarios. We discover that while warming lake water and sediment temperature plays an important role, the climate impact on ice-on periods is a key indicator of future emissions. We conclude that these boreal lakes remain a significant methane source under the warming climate within this century.</p>","boreal lake, climate change, eaps, methane emission","Mingyang Guo, Zeli Tan, Pirkko Kortelainen, Pertti Martikainen, Narasinha Shurpali, Sari Juutinen, Qianlai Zhuang"

Between survey years (2003-2018), it has become a dominant, important species in areas once uninvaded, may be facilitating stabilization and converging communities.","<p>Perched sand dunes are vulnerable ecosystems along the Great Lakes, including Grand Sable Dunes in Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. Spotted knapweed is a non-native plant species that has colonized these dunes and spread into increasingly more areas of the ecosystem. I conducted plant surveys in areas with and without spotted knapweed in 2003, and then resurveyed those areas in 2018. Frequency of spotted knapweed increased in both areas surveyed. Additionally, dominance shifted with spotted knapweed becoming the most important species in the area originally invaded and third most important in the area originally uninvaded. There were approximately 2/3 of species shared between the two survey years, but twelve of 29 species added in 2018 were woody. Species richness increased between years, as did species diversity. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination displayed community shifts as convergent succession. While the plant communities in the two areas were rather dissimilar in 2003, they converged as overlapping communities in 2018. Additionally, the shift between years in the area originally invaded was smaller compared to the shift between years in the area originally uninvaded. Due to the continuous evolution of plant communities within sand dune ecosystems, there is a need to monitor changes and quantify non-native species spread patterns. Dominance by spotted knapweed may be facilitating dune stabilization and converging communities along a modified successional trajectory.</p>","biology, centaurea stoebe, ecology, great lakes, invasive species, plant survey, sand dunes, succession","Jordan M Marshall"

Exposures included perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS) at 0, 80, 800, or 8000 ppb on a moss dry weight basis. Exposure to PFAS influenced final snout-vent length (SVL) and scaled mass index (SMI), a measure of relative body condition. Observed effects depended on species and chemical, but not concentration. Anurans exposed to PFOS, PFHxS (frogs only), and 6:2 FTS reduced SVL versus controls, while salamanders exposed to 6:2 FTS increased SVL. Frogs exposed to PFHxS and 6:2 FTS, and toads exposed to PFOS had increased SMI compared to controls, salamanders did not demonstrate effects. Concentrations of 6:2 FTS in substrate decreased substantially by 30 d, likely driven by microbial action. PFOS had notable biota-sediment accumulation factors, but still &lt; 1.

<p>The Uniform Soybean Tests, Northern Region, have been in place since 1941. The tests evaluate yield, disease resistance, and quality traits of public breeding lines from northern states of the U.S. and Canadian provinces. The purpose of The Uniform Soybean Tests is to critically evaluate the best of the experimental soybean lines developed by federal and state research personnel in the U.S. and Canada, for their potential release as new varieties.</p>

<p>A test is established for each of ten maturity groups. Uniform Test 00 includes maturity Group 00 strains adapted to production in the northern fringe of the present area of soybean production. Uniform Tests 0 through IV include later maturing strains adapted to locations progressively further south in the North Central States and areas of similar latitude. Each year new selections are added and others that have been sufficiently tested are dropped from the tests. The summary of performance of strains in Uniform Tests 00 through IV in the northern region is included in this report. The USDA-ARS Soybean Production Research Unit, P.O. BOX 345, STONEVILLE, MS 38776, issues the report on Uniform Tests IVS through VIII in the southern states.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Data from the Uniform Soybean Tests are the basis for decisions on the regional release of soybean varieties. Preliminary Tests are grown at a limited number of locations throughout the region to evaluate the experimental strains for one year before they are dropped or advanced in the Uniform Tests. Uniform Tests are grown at more locations with more replications than Preliminary Tests.</p>

In Central America, the current prevalence and infection intensity suggest that <i>Bd</i> infection is endemic and widespread. Therefore, an update of the distribution of <i>Bd</i> is urgently needed, especially in countries like Costa Rica where highly susceptible species may be experiencing recovery from historic <i>Bd</i>-driven declines. We built a comprehensive dataset of 451 <i>Bd</i>-positive records from 34 localities across Costa Rica (50 through histology and 401 through PCR methods). Then we used the maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) to predict the post-decline habitat suitability for <i>Bd</i> in Costa Rica. We found that the current distribution of <i>Bd</i> in Costa Rica is larger than predicted in previous suitability maps and now extends to regions that had historically tested negative for <i>Bd</i> with histology, especially highlands above 2500 m elevation and dry lowlands considered refuges from chytridiomycosis. We also found evidence that most sampling of <i>Bd</i> in Costa Rica has been opportunistic and focused on sites where historic epizootic declines occurred, leading to deficient sampling on numerous regions. We identified disease hotspots across the Caribbean side and Central Mountain range of Costa Rica. Our results suggest that PCR methods and large sample sizes are needed to accurately detect disease hotspots. Developing accurate estimates of pathogen distribution is essential for the effective management of susceptible populations. Our results can be used to prioritize species, regions, and actions to mitigate future outbreaks of this deadly pathogen.</p>","batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, biological sciences, chytridiomycosis, disease, habitat suitability, histology, host, qpcr","Hector H.

<p>Samples from various water sources (rain, snow, glacial ice, subglacial melt, proglacial lake, etc.)&nbsp;in alpine regions, as well as regional springs and streams, were collected over multiple field campaigns to Mount Hood National Forest and Glacier National Park and analyzed for stable isotopes (d<sup>18</sup>O and d<sup>2</sup>H). Using stable isotopes in this manner allows for identifying sources and fractional contributions of recharge to mountain groundwater systems. Additionally, samples of the microbes in these water samples were collected and analyzed. The SSU rRNA raw sequence read data have been deposited with links to BioProject accession number PRJNA629965 in the NCBI BioProject database (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/</a>).&nbsp;</p>

	<li>to document and illustrate approximations available for Gauss quadrature weights and Christoffel functions.</li>
</ol>

<p>With regard to 1., the number <em>n</em> of quadrature points and the desirable precision (number of digits) can be arbitrary, and so are the values of parameters possibly present in the weight function. With regard to 2., there are known approximations for quadrature weights when the support interval of the weight function is finite. We conjecture them, and provide evidence for them, to be valid also for the corresponding Christoffel functions. The case of half-infinite and infinite support intervals is more intriguing: there are known approximations for quadrature weights in the case of Laguerre and Hermite weight functions. They are conjectured here to apply also to Christoffel functions. Indeed, if multiplied by appropriate constants (depending on <em>n</em>), they all seem to be valid for essentially arbitrary weight functions.</p>

<p>The repository contains over fifty datasets, each dealing with a particular weight function. We distinguish between classical, quasi-classical, and non-classical weight functions and associated orthogonal polynomials. The classical ones include the well-established polynomials associated with such names as Jacobi, Laguerre, Hermite, Meixner, and Pollaczek. Quasi-classical orthogonal polynomials share with the classical ones the fact that their three-term recurrence relation is known in closed form, whereas for non-classical ones, the recurrence relation is not known explicitly and must be generated by one of several known methods.</p>","christoffel function, computer science, gaussian quadrature, mathematics, modification algorithms for orthogonal polynomials, orthogonal polynomials, walter gautschi archives, weight functions","Walter Gautschi, Stanislav Pejša"

When multiple natural enemy species share a host, shifts in host-parasitoid dynamics could depend on whether natural enemies interact antagonistically versus synergistically. We investigated how biotic and abiotic factors influence the population ecology of larch casebearer (<i>Coleophora laricella</i>), a non-native pest, and two imported parasitoids, <i>Agathis pumila </i>and <i>Chrysocharis laricinellae</i>, by analyzing (i) temporal dynamics in defoliation from 1962-2018 and (ii) historical, branch-level data on densities of larch casebearer and parasitism rates by the two imported natural enemies from 1972-1995. Analyses of defoliation indicated that, prior to the introduction of parasitoids (1962 to ~1980), larch casebearer outbreaks occurred in 2 to 6 year cycles. This pattern was followed by a &gt;15-year period during which populations were at low, apparently stable densities undetectable via aerial surveys, presumably under control from parasitoids. However, since the late 1990s and despite the persistence of both parasitoids, outbreaks exhibiting unstable dynamics have occurred. Analyses of branch-level data indicated that growth of casebearer populations, <i>A. pumila </i>populations, and within-casebearer densities of <i>Ch. laricinellae</i> &ndash; a generalist whose population dynamics are likely also influenced by use of alternative hosts &ndash; were inhibited by density-dependence, with high intraspecific densities in one year slowing growth into the next. Casebearer population growth was also inhibited by parasitism from <i>A. pumila</i>, but not <i>Ch. </i><i>laricinellae</i>, and increased with warmer autumnal temperatures. Growth of <i>A. pumila </i>populations and within-casebearer densities of<i> Ch. laricinellae </i>increased with casebearer densities but decreased with warmer annual maximum temperatures. Moreover, parasitism by <i>A. pumila </i>was associated with increased growth of within-casebearer densities of <i>Ch. laricinellae </i>without adverse effects on its own demographics, indicating a synergistic interaction between these parasitoids. Our results indicate that warming can be associated with opposing effects between trophic levels, with deleterious effects of warming on one natural enemy species<i> </i>potentially being exacerbated by similar impacts on another. Coupling of such parasitoid responses with positive responses of hosts to warming might have contributed to the return of casebearer outbreaks to North America.</p>","climate change, forest, forestry and natural resources, insect, parasitoids","Songlin Fei, Samuel Ward, Andrew Liebhold, Brian Aukema"

Invasive richness in forests decreased as distance from the nearest TTC increased. Directly adjacent to TTCs, there were an estimated 1.4 &plusmn; 0.01 SE invasive plant species per plot compared to 0.7 &plusmn; 0.01 and 0.2 &plusmn; 0.01 species at 1 km and 3 km, respectively, away from the nearest TTC.

Our macroscale analysis also demonstrated that rates of decay in invasive richness away from TTCs was mediated by the types of land use and ecological provinces within which plots were located. The influences of TTCs and associated activities (e.g., construction, travel) on invasive plant richness were widespread across forests of the eastern USA, but the relative importance of TTCs for facilitating spread appear to be highly context dependent.</p>

<p>Cdc14 enzymes have been reported to be required for normal plant infection by several plant pathogen species. In the SSP Biochemistry program, research groups of 3 participants each purify and characterize the Cdc14 homolog encoded by a different plant fungal pathogen species. Each group is initially given the gene sequence for the putative Cdc14 homolog from a phytopathogenic fungus. Their overall goal is to determine if this protein would be a suitable target for development of a novel fungicide to protect crops from pathogens. They first use bioinformatic tools to generate a hypothesis about the function of the protein encoded by their gene sequence. Then, they use a recombinant&nbsp;plasmid to overexpress their protein in <em>E. coli</em> and purify it using nickel affinity chromatography. They characterize steady-state kinetic properties and substrate specificity of their enzymes and compare the results to previously characterized Cdc14 from the model fungal species <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> (ScCdc14), for which structural information is available. They then design an assay to test inhibition of their enzyme by a series of compounds originally identified as<em> in vitro</em> inhibitors of ScCdc14. They choose the best one, perform computational docking to predict how it might bind to the homology-based structural model of their enzyme&rsquo;s active site that they previously generated, and finally hypothesize about ways to optimize their inhibitor structure to improve binding and specificity by taking advantage of known features of Cdc14 substrates. In the end they&nbsp;conclude whether or not the active site substrate specificity is conserved enough to justify using the ScCdc14 structure as a model for designing inhibitors to their enzyme.

<p>In summary, SSP is a highly selective 39 day residential research program in which high school students from around the world (mostly rising seniors and most located in the United States) conduct authentic research in the area of biochemistry and drug discovery in a supportive peer community, using state-of-the art tools and facilities. Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN is one of the host campuses, with 36 annual participants.&nbsp;The program seeks to foster a passion for careers in STEM while providing students with a unique opportunity to experience and do real science research when they are still in high school. The curriculum combines classroom learning activities focused on theoretical principles of biochemistry and research methods used by participants with hands-on wet lab and computational experimentation.</p>

<p><b>The Research Project in SSP Biochemistry</b></p>

<p>Cdc14 enzymes have been reported to be required for normal plant infection by several plant pathogen species. In the SSP Biochemistry program, research groups of 3 participants each purify and characterize the Cdc14 homolog encoded by a different plant fungal pathogen species. Each group is initially given the gene sequence for the putative Cdc14 homolog from a phytopathogenic fungus. Their overall goal is to determine if this protein would be a suitable target for development of a novel fungicide to protect crops from pathogens. They first use bioinformatic tools to generate a hypothesis about the function of the protein encoded by their gene sequence. Then, they use a recombinant&nbsp;plasmid to overexpress their protein in <i>E. coli</i> and purify it using nickel affinity chromatography. They characterize steady-state kinetic properties and substrate specificity of their enzymes and compare the results to previously characterized Cdc14 from the model fungal species <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (ScCdc14), for which structural information is available. They then design an assay to test inhibition of their enzyme by a series of compounds originally identified as <i>in vitro</i> inhibitors of ScCdc14. They choose the best one, perform computational docking to predict how it might bind to the homology-based structural model of their enzyme&rsquo;s active site that they previously generated, and finally hypothesize about ways to optimize their inhibitor structure to improve binding and specificity by taking advantage of known features of Cdc14 substrates. In the end they&nbsp;conclude whether or not the active site substrate specificity is conserved enough to justify using the ScCdc14 structure as a model for designing inhibitors to their enzyme. In this series, each dataset reports the&nbsp;biochemical results and the homology based structural modeling of the Cdc14 homolog from a different fungal pathogen species.</p>","antifungal design, biochemistry, cdc14 phosphatase, enzyme function, high school summer research, phytopathogenic fungi, plant pathogens, summer science program","Alan Tondryk, Alex Jiale Dong, Alex Liu, Alex Wang, Allen Zihang Wu, Alyssa Marie Questell, Amanda Grace Wilson, Angela Gao, Anicia Anjel Miller, Anusha Sriram, Ayse Beren Guler, Ayush Pandit, Beatriz Barrera-Cisneros, Benjamin Ari Schussheim, Benjamin Diskerud Malin, Benjamin Thomas, Blen Kedir, Brandon Li Gong, Bryan William SebaRaj, Callee Elizabeth Cabrera, Cameron Uy, Caroline Katz, Cathleen Liang, Cecilia Leber, Charles William Coffey, Christopher Wang, Christopher Ye, Claire Kim, Ecem Sena Uluegeci, Elizabeth Chen, Emily Dong Wang, Eric John Yuan, Evan Ash Yandell, Felipe Calero, Fenry Wilson Zhou, Hyowon Kang, Hyunjun Ahn, James Yin, James Yuxuan Chen, Jared Smith, Jeffrey Han, Jennifer Hong, Jenny Cai, Jeonghyun Yoo, Jesse Eugene Pattison, Jessie Lee, Joyce An, Juan Antonio Serna, Kaitlyn D Crowley, Kathryn Ann Tso, Kavya Mehul Shah, Ketan Jog, Kevin Tan, Laney Flanagan, Lea Elena Twicken, Leyna Duong, Lucien Tsai, Mai N.

<p>The data provided in this publication was used to deliver the first detailed mechanical analysis of splash curtain, providing a physical understanding on why the splash curtain sometimes seals, and other times it does not.<b> </b></p>

<p>When an object impacts the free surface of a liquid, it ejects a splash curtain upwards and creates an air cavity below the free surface. As the object descends into the liquid, the air cavity eventually closes under the action of hydrostatic pressure (deep seal). In contrast, the surface curtain may splash outwards or dome over and close, creating a surface seal. We experimentally investigate how the splash curtain dynamics are governed by the interplay of cavity pressure difference, gravity, and surface tension and how they control the occurrence, or not, of surface seal. Based on the experimental observations and measurements, we develop an analytical model to describe the trajectory and dynamics of the splash curtain. The model enables us to reveal the scaling relationship for the dimensionless surface seal time and discover the existence of a critical dimensionless number that predicts the occurrence of surface seal. This scaling indicates that the most significant parameter governing the occurrence of surface seal is the velocity of the airflow rushing into the cavity. This is in contrast to the current understanding which considers the impact velocity as the determinant parameter.</p>

<p>Lakes have important influence on weather and climate from local to global scales. However, their prediction using numerical models is notoriously difficult because global lakes are highly heterogeneous across the globe and observations are sparse. Here, we assessed the performance of a 1-D lake model in simulating the thermal structures of 58 lakes with diverse morphometric and geographic characteristics by following the phase 2a local lake protocol of the Inter-sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP2a). The model was calibrated using six years of observation data for each lake and validated using the remaining data. After model calibration, the root-mean-square errors (RMSE) were below 2&nbsp;&deg;C for 70% and 75% of the lakes for epilimnion temperature and full-profile temperature simulations, with an average of 1.71&nbsp;&deg;C and 1.43&nbsp;<a name=""OLE_LINK1""></a><a name=""OLE_LINK2"">&deg;C</a>, respectively. The model performance mainly depends on lake shape rather than location, supporting the possibility of grouping model parameters by lake shape for global applications. Furthermore, through machine-learning based parameter sensitivity tests, we identified turbulent heat fluxes, wind-driven mixing and water transparency as the major processes controlling lake thermal and mixing regimes. Snow density is also a sensitive parameter for modeling the ice phenology of high latitude lakes. The relative influence of the key processes and the corresponding parameters mainly depended on lake latitude and depth. Turbulent heat fluxes showed a decreasing importance in affecting lake epilimnion temperature with increasing latitude. Wind-driven mixing was less influential to lake vertical temperature profile for deeper lakes while the impact of light extinction, on the contrary, showed a positive correlation with depth on lake stratification. Our findings may guide improvements in 1-D lake model parameterizations to achieve higher fidelity in simulating global lake thermal dynamics.&nbsp;</p>","eaps, global lake thermal dynamics, lake model, sensitivity test","Mingyang Guo, Qianlai Zhuang, Huaxia Yao, Malgorzata Golub, L.

<p>Peatlands are important sources and sinks for carbon-based greenhouse gases. The quantification of their carbon accumulation still has a large uncertainty due to large data gaps and lack of process-based modeling tools. Here, a process-based biogeochemistry model developed for peatland ecosystems was calibrated based on peatland site-level data of long-term peat C accumulation rates. The model was then applied to quantify the C accumulation rates and stocks within North America peatlands over the last 12,000 years. We estimated that 85-174 Pg C were accumulated in North American peatlands over the study period including 0.37-0.76 Pg C in subtropical peatlands. Our model suggested that during the period from 10,000 to 8,000 years ago, the warmer and wetter conditions might have played an important role in stimulating peat C accumulation by enhancing plant photosynthesis. Enhanced peat decomposition due to warming slowed the C accumulation through the rest of the Holocene.</p>","eaps, holocene, north america, peatland, p-tem, soil carbon","Qianlai Zhuang, Sirui Wang, Bailu Zhao, Filipe Aires, Catherine Prigent, Zicheng Yu, Jason K.

<p>Wildfires are a major disturbance to influence forest carbon balance through both immediate combustion emissions and post-fire ecosystem carbon dynamics.&nbsp; Here we use a process-based biogeochemistry model, the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model, to simulate carbon budget in Alaska and Canada during 1986-2016 considering fire disturbances. The difference Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) data for fires are extracted from Landsat TM/ETM imagery, and used to estimate the proportion of vegetation and soil carbon combustion. We find that the region is a carbon source of 2.74 Pg C during the 31-year period. The loss is attributed to fire emissions at 57.1 Tg C/yr, overwhelming the net ecosystem production at 1.9 Tg C/yr in the region. Our during-fire emission for Alaska and Canada are lower than some field measurements and model estimations (for Alaska: 1.4 Tg C/yr versus 1.6-3.3 Tg C/yr; for Canada: 2.1 Tg C/yr versus 1.3-4.3 Tg C/yr). Fire severity complicates after-fire carbon dynamics, with low severity fires increase soil temperature and decrease soil moisture, stimulating soil respiration. However, the opposite trend is found under moderate or high fire severity. Net nitrogen mineralization rates gradually recovered after fire, enhancing net primary production.

Hundreds of recent studies have voiced concern over the negative impacts of non-target pesticides on pollinator health. However, pesticide loads are highly variable across agricultural landscapes and it is unclear whether pollinators exhibit behavioral responses (e.g., aversion) that mediate their exposure risk under realistic foraging environments.</p>

<p>2. We tested whether monarch butterfly (<em>Danaus plexippus</em>) adults and larvae base their oviposition and foraging decisions, respectively, on the presence and concentration of pesticide residues on their milkweed host-plant,&nbsp;<em>Asclepias syriaca</em>. To do so, we experimentally simulated field-realistic exposure for six of the most commonly detected pesticides&mdash;one insecticide, two herbicides, and three fungicides&mdash;either alone or in combination. These laboratory and greenhouse manipulations experimentally paired an untreated control with the pesticides at their mean or maximum concentrations. Last, we used a two-year field survey to correlate pesticide concentration on milkweed leaves with monarch oviposition.</p>

<p>3. Butterflies placed fewer eggs on milkweeds treated with a cocktail containing all six pesticides at their maximum concentrations, resulting in ca. 30% less oviposition compared to the solvent control. Neonate (1st instar) larvae also showed a preference for pesticide-free leaves in paired disc assays for 4 out of 6 compounds tested, with feeding aversion observed at both mean and maximum concentrations. Later instars did not show a comparable behavioral reaction to pesticide presence or concentration, but this could be partially due to the feeding-deterrent properties of the acetone solvent used. In the field, per plant egg load was negatively correlated with increasing leaf concentration for one of the herbicides, metolachlor; although all pesticides tested showed similar oviposition trends.</p>

<p>4. Synthesis and applications. Our data provide evidence that monarchs are capable of adaptively adjusting their oviposition and foraging behaviors based on which pesticides are present on their host-plants. Importantly, this preference was observed at field-relevant concentrations, suggesting that monarchs behaviorally regulate pesticide exposure risk for their offspring by avoiding contaminated plants. Variability in pesticide identity and/or load among milkweeds within/between habitat patches should be considered in future restoration efforts aimed at attracting butterflies for larval development, as well as the relative importance of pesticides compared with other plant factors (e.g., genotype or species, developmental stage) known to affect oviposition. More broadly, this work illustrates some of the limitations of no-choice trials and suggests that experimental designs embracing field-scale heterogeneity in pesticide presence and concentration will lead to more realistic non-target impact assessments.</p>","agroecosystems, behavioral response, butterfly, entomology, milkweed, monarchs, pesticides, pollinators","Michael E Scharf, Ian Kaplan, Paola Olaya-Arenas, Paola Andrea Olaya Arenas"

Nicholas Rauh has directed these efforts, assisted by Matthew Dillon (Loyola Marymount U.), Caroline Autret (U. Paris-Sorbonne), and Asena Kızılarslanoğlu (Kastamonu U.). Student participants include Joshua Dandridge, Joseph Rynasko, Brian Stroinski, Daniela Tlumacova, Adam Freeburg, Nathan McBurnett, Emily Getz, Zoey Osterloh, and Kenneth Klimek. It needs to be emphasized that the materials preserved in the Alanya Museum represent a small fraction of the context materials processed by the pedestrian team in the field. Through the years most of the pottery processed by the team was left <em>in situ</em> at their find spots. At each location Rauh made a practice of collecting relatively small samplings of representative types and / or unique forms that warranted further analysis to be brought to the survey headquarters. These samplings were &ldquo;bagged and tagged,&rdquo; and brought to the laboratory where they were cleaned, coded, and reprocessed. For the most part the materials stored in the Alanya Archaeological Museum represent the preserved elements of these samplings.&nbsp; With the cessation of the field survey in 2011, Rauh was able to obtain permission from the Turkish General Directorate for Cultural Heritage and Museums to revisit the materials stored in the Alanya Museum. We have conducted study seasons at the museum every year since 2014.</p>

<p>This work has proceeded for the most part in chronological order, beginning with revisions to the RCSP Study Collection and Context Collections of 1996-1998. This was essential because our existing records predated the project&rsquo;s adaptation to digital photography. Due to the high cost of film processing, images for the remains were originally limited for the most part to group photographs of context collections grouped according to forms and typologies. During our study seasons we have treated the materials individually and completed digital photography, measurements, sherd descriptions, fabric descriptions, and Munsell colorations for each individual sherd. From 2014 to 2018, this work progressed slowly as the team works its way through the stored context bags from 1996 to 2001. The revisions, photographs, and profile drawings for these seasons were incorporated into the datasets that were mounted at PURR in Spring 2019. In Summer 2019 Rauh and Asena Kızılarslanoğlu examined the context collections of the 2002-2004 survey seasons. &nbsp;Context collections we revisited include those at Charadros, Govan Asarı, G&ouml;kcebelen Kale, Gurcam Kale, Hisar Asarı, Ilica Kale, Kaletepe, and Kenetepe. In the time available we were able to process some 274 items, generating some 1500 photographs and 80 profile drawings. We have mounted these results in this Addendum and Corrigendum dataset. Work remains to be completed with the pottery collections from 2004-2011, as well as with the accumulated collections from the region&rsquo;s amphora kiln sites (the Bi&ccedil;kici, the Syedra, the Antioch, and the Delice Kiln Sites, respectively). We will continue to post revised datasets as addenda for these materials until all the stored materials have been re-examined. At that point we will incorporate all addenda datasets into a revised version of the RCSP Context Pottery datasets. We are extremely grateful to Dr. Seher T&uuml;rkmen, the director of the Alanya Archaeological Museum, and her dedicated staff for supporting the work of the survey by furnishing storage and research facilities at the museum. Their cooperation has proven invaluable.</p>

SM/ST products obtained from high-resolution, land data assimilation system (LDAS) are used in the direct initialization of land surface conditions in the ARW modeling system. In the indirect method, the initial SM is sequentially adjusted through the flux-adjusting surface data assimilation system (FASDAS). These two approaches are compared with a control experiment (CNTL) involving climatological SM/ST conditions for eight MDs at 4-km horizontal resolution.</p>

<p>The surface fields simulated by the LDAS run showed the highest agreement, followed by FASDAS for relatively dry June cases, but the error is high (~15-30%) for the relatively wet August cases. The moisture budget indicates that moisture convergence and local influence contributed more to rainfall. The surface-rainfall feedback analysis reveals that surface conditions and evaporation have a dominant impact on the rainfall simulation, and these couplings are notable in LDAS runs. The contiguous rain area (CRA) method indicates better performance of LDAS for very heavy rainfall distribution, and the location (ETS&gt;0.2), compared to FASDAS and CNTL. The pattern error contributes the maximum to the total rainfall error, and the displacement error is more in August cases&rsquo; rainfall than that in June cases. Overall analyses indicated that the role of land conditions is significantly high in the drier month (June) than a wet month (August), and direct initialization of SM/ST fields yielded improved MD and heavy rain simulations.</p>","arw model, eaps, fasdas, hrldas, monsoon depressions, soil moisture simulation, soil temperature","Dev S.

This methodology enables the simulation of aero-thermodynamics experiments for experiment design, error, and uncertainty analysis. Images are generated by emanating light rays from the particles or dot pattern, and propagating them through the density gradient field and the optical elements, up to the camera sensor. The rendered images are realistic, and can replicate the features of a given experimental setup, like optical aberrations and perspective effects, which can be deliberately introduced for error analysis. We demonstrate this methodology by simulating a BOS experiment with a known density field obtained from direct numerical simulations of homogeneous buoyancy driven turbulence, and comparing the light ray displacements from ray tracing to results from BOS theory. The light ray displacements show good agreement with the reference data. This methodology provides a framework for further development of simulation tools for use in experiment design and development of image analysis tools for PIV and BOS applications. An implementation of the proposed methodology in a Python-CUDA program is made available as an open source software for researchers.</p>

The method improves the accuracy, precision and spatial resolution compared to conventional cross-correlation algorithms. Our methodology utilizes the prior information about the dot pattern such as the location, size and number of dots to provide near 100% yield even for high dot densities (20 dots/32 &times; 32 pixels) and is robust to image noise. We also propose an improvement to the displacement estimation step in the tracking process, especially for noisy images, using a &ldquo;correlation correction&rdquo;, whereby we combine the spatial resolution benefit of the tracking method and the smoothing property of the correlation method to increase the dynamic range of the overall measurement process. We evaluate the performance of the method with synthetic BOS images of buoyancy-driven turbulence rendered using ray-tracing simulations, and experimental images of flow in the exit plane of a converging&ndash;diverging nozzle. The results show that the improved spatial resolution results in a better accuracy of the tracking method compared to correlation-based methods in regions with sharp displacement gradients, and the correlation correction step reduces the noise floor of the measurement, resulting in a fourfold improvement in the dynamic range.</p>","aeronautics and astronautics engineering, background oriented schlieren, image processing, matlab, particle tracking velocimetry","Lalit Rajendran, Pavlos Vlachos, Sally P M Bane"

However, recent studies report pesticide residues on milkweed leaves that could act as a contributing factor when ingested as part of their larval diet. In this study, we exposed monarch larvae to six pesticides (insecticide: clothianidin; herbicides: atrazine, s-metolachlor; fungicides: azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin) on their primary host-plant, <em>A. syriaca</em>. Each was tested at mean and maximum levels reported from published analyses of milkweeds bordering cropland and thus represent field-relevant concentrations. Monarch lethal and sub-lethal responses were tracked over their complete development, from early instar larvae to adult death. Overall, we found no impact of any pesticide on immature development time and relatively weak effects on larval herbivory or survival to adulthood. Comparatively stronger effects were detected for adult performance; namely, a 12.5% reduction in wing length in response to the fungicides azoxystrobin and trifloxystrobin. These data collectively suggest that monarch responses to host-plant pesticides are largely sublethal and more pronounced in the adult stage, despite exposure only as larvae. This outcome has important implications for risk assessment and the migratory success of monarchs in North America.</p>","agriculture, entomology, milkweed, monarchs, pesticides","Ian Kaplan, Michael E.

Data was used, to perform dimensional analysis to relate peak impact force to the aforementioned variables of interest.","<p>It has been documented that up to 22% of all soccer injuries are concussions. This is in part due to players purposely using their head to direct the ball during play. To provide a more complete understanding of head trauma in soccer athletes, this study characterized the effects of four soccer ball characteristics (size, inflation pressure, mass, velocity) on the resulting peak impact force as it relates to the potential for incurring neurophysiological changes. A total of six hundred trials were performed on size 4 and 5 soccer balls as well as a novel lightweight soccer ball. Impact force was measured with a force plate and ball velocity was determined using motion capture. These data were used, in conjunction with dimensional analysis to relate impact force to ball size, mass, velocity, and pressure. Reasonable reductions in allowable ball parameters resulted in a 19.7% decrease in peak impact force. Adjustments to ball parameters could reduce a high cumulative peak translational acceleration soccer athlete down into a previously defined safer low loading range. In addition, it was noted that water absorption by soccer balls can result in masses that substantially increase impact force and quickly surpass the NCAA weight limit for game play. Additional research is required to determine whether varying soccer ball characteristics will enable soccer players to avoid persistent neurophysiological deficits or what additional interventions may be necessary and the legal implications of these data are discussed.</p>","health and kinesiology, mild traumatic brain injury, peak impact force, soccer, soccer ball, soccer biomechanics, soccer headers","Josh Auger, Justin Merkel, Dimitri Pecoski, Thomas Talavage, Larry Leverenz, Francis Shen, Eric Nauman, Nicolas Leiva-Molano"

While routinely soil chambers have been used to measure emissions from small plots, measuring field-scale emissions with micrometeorological methods has been limited. This study implemented a backward Lagrangian stochastic (bLS) technique to simultaneously and near-continuously measure N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from four adjacent fields of approximately 1-ha each. A scanning open-path Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (OP-FTIR), edge-of-field gas sampling and measurement, locally measured turbulence, and bLS emissions modeling were integrated to measure N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from four adjacent fields of maize production using different management in 2015. The maize N management treatments consisted of 220 kg NH<sub>3</sub>-N ha<sup>-1</sup>&nbsp;applied either as one application in the fall after harvest or spring before planting or split between fall after harvest and spring before planting. The field preparation treatments evaluated were no-till (NT) and chisel plow (ChP). This study showed that the management of the full-N rate applied in fall led to higher N<sub>2</sub>O emissions than the split-N rates applied in the fall and spring. Based on the same N application (i.e., split-N rates applied in the fall and spring), the ChP practice tended to increase N<sub>2</sub>O emissions compared with NT. The method had a minimum detection limit (MDL) of &plusmn;1.2 &micro;gm<sup>-2</sup>&nbsp;s<sup>-1</sup>&nbsp;(3&sigma;). The averaged emission rates of the four treatments over 41 days after the spring fertilizer application ranged from 0.8 to 3.9 &micro;g m<sup>-2</sup>&nbsp;s<sup>-1</sup>.

However, to serve as an effective substitute for restoration, hybrids must survive and reproduce in the same distribution as the target species. An ecophysiological evaluation of hybrids versus progenitor species could contribute to predicting potential hybrid distribution and utilization areas. <em>Juglans cinerea </em>L. is an endangered, exceptionally cold hardy North American tree species that can hybridize with the non-native <em>Juglans ailantifolia </em>Carr. Preliminary evidence indicates their hybrids could hold resistance to <em>Ophiognomonia clavigignenti-juglandacearum</em>, the fungal disease threatening <em>J. cinerea.</em> Consequently, hybrids are being evaluated as a possible conservation tool. This study aims to compare relative cold and heat tolerances within <em>J. cinerea</em> provenances (USDA plant hardiness zones 4, colder, to 7, warmer) and between <em>J. cinerea</em>, <em>J. ailantifolia</em>, and their hybrids (F1 hybrids - <em>J. cinerea </em>&times; <em>J. ailantifolia</em>, and backcross hybrids - F1 &times; <em>J. cinerea</em>). For the cold test, current-year twigs were subjected to five freeze treatments (-38 to 5 &deg;C). Resulting damage was estimated using electrolyte leakage. In the heat test, leaflets were subjected to six hot water bath treatments (30 to 54 &deg;C) and damage was estimated as change in chlorophyll fluorescence. Cold tolerance differed more than heat tolerance among <em>J. cinerea</em> provenances and across species. Within <em>J. cinerea, </em>trees from colder areas exhibited less cold damage than those from warmer areas. Differences in heat damage between hardiness zones occurred, but did not follow a clear trend. Consequently, at the intraspecific level cold and heat tolerance were not correlated. However, at the interspecific level cold and heat tolerance were negatively correlated. <em>J. cinerea</em> exhibited greatest cold tolerance, <em>J. ailantifolia</em> exhibited greatest heat tolerance, and hybrids were intermediate. Thus, the utility of hybrids for restoration could be limited at the ecophysiological extremes of species&rsquo; distributions.</p>","abiotic stress, butternut, chlorophyll fluorescence, electrolyte leakage, extreme temperature stress, forestry and natural resources, hybridization, japanese walnut, white walnut","Andrea N Brennan, Douglass F Jacobs, Mercedes Uscola, Robert James Joly"

The project is investigating an ancient maritime littoral landscape extending from modern-day Silifke to Yeşilovacık (Silifke District, Mersin Province).&nbsp;in what was eastern Rough Cilicia during Antiquity (<a href=""http://www.bogsakarchaeology.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.bogsakarchaeology.org</a>). The project has been ongoing since 2010&nbsp;and focuses on a number of ancient island settlements and harbors along this shore, including Boğsak Island, Dana Island (ancient Pityoussa), Tahtalimanı, and the Ovacık Peninsula (ancient Aphrodisias). Professor Nicholas Rauh of Purdue University joined the project in 2015 and has conducted pedestrian survey to collect ceramic data for the project.</p>

<p>Approximately 7ha in size, the Turkish island of Boğsak is situated 300m off-shore of the modern village of Boğsak, &nbsp;approximately 15 km. south of Silifke, the modern-day site of the ancient city, <i>Seleucia ad Calycadnum</i>. Under the direction of G&uuml;nder Varinlioğlu, the BOGA survey is meticulously mapping the archaeological remains of the remarkably dense Late Roman settlement on the island.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pedestrian survey is intended to complement the work of the architectural investigation by furnishing it with datable archaeological contexts as provided by surface ceramics collections. &nbsp;The difficulties posed by the island&rsquo;s uneven surface is compounded by loose layers of wall fall, dense patches of garrigue scrub brush, and the equally hazardous challenges posed by snakes and scorpions. Throughout the island, dense concentrations of highly fragmented surface pottery lie strewn amid the brush-covered ruins. To conduct the pedestrian survey, team members designated transects or collection areas capable of sampling surface remains at various quadrants of the island (along each of its shores as well as on the high ground near the main church complex at its center). Within each transect team members selected a specific &ldquo;locus&rdquo; to investigate, be that the interior of a ruined building or an open area amid the surrounding brush. When selecting &ldquo;loci&rdquo;, the guiding principle was to maximize output by focusing on surfaces exhibiting high visibility. Each designated area was assigned a transect and locus (&quot;unit&quot; in the datasets) number recorded with GPS coordinates. Within each locus team members conducted grab collections of diagnostic sherds. Each sherd was quickly processed and photographed in the field. Particularly useful sherds were returned to the field laboratory where they were cleaned, measured, re-photographed, and drawn. All sherds were then returned to the island. . In this manner some 52 loci were inspected across 5&nbsp;transects in 2015 (SEE MAP). Participants on the pedestrian team included Adam Freeburg (Purdue U.), Hilal K&uuml;nt&uuml;z (Mimar Sinan U.), and Beste&nbsp;Eyupoğlu (Mimar Sinan U.).&nbsp;</p>","ancient greece, archaeological survey, archaeology, boğsak, ceramics, classical studies, geoarchaeology, languages, pottery, rough cilicia, turkey","Günder Varinlioglu, Nicholas Kregotis Rauh, Rick Wohmann, Stanislav Pejša"

During the 2016 Season of the project the BOGA pedestrian survey team conducted a week-long training session on Boğsak Island, July 19-27, 2016. This exercise was conducted largely in preparation for the team&#39;s relocation to Dana Island later that summer, but it did turn up significant finds on Boğsak prior to departure and expanded our coverage on the island. In all, 6 to 8 walkers investigated 28 loci or units in 5 transects on Boğsak (see map in dataset gallery). They processed 495 ceramic, stone, and glass fragments. Pedestrian team members included Nick Rauh, Prof. Noah Kaye (Indiana U.), Prof. Matthew Dillon (Loyola Marymount U.), and students, Peter Kotiuga (Indiana U.), Lucy Greene (Purdue U.), Nur Erdemci, Gamze G&uuml;rgen&ccedil; and Cem Ardıl, all from Mimar Sinan U. in Istanbul.</p>

<p>During the 2017 season, while focusing on the continuing investigation of Dana Island, the pedestrian team was asked by the director, Dr. G&uuml;nder Varinlioğlu, to do some sampling in the circular precinct near Church 1 on Boğsak. where she was conducting architectural mapping.

Here we evaluate the algorithms of four key lake thermal processes including turbulent heat fluxes, wind-driven mixing, light extinction, and snow density, using a highly diverse lake dataset provided by the Inter-sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) 2a lake sector. Algorithm codes are configured and run separately within the same parent model to rule out any interference from factors apart from the algorithms examined. Evaluations are based on both simulation accuracy and recalibration complexity for application to global lakes. For turbulent heat fluxes, the non-Monin-Obukhov similarity (MOS) based, more simplified algorithms perform better in predicting lake epilimnion temperatures and achieve high convergence in the values of the calibrated parameters. For wind-driven mixing, a two-algorithm strategy considering lake shape and season is suggested with the regular mixing algorithm used for spring and earlier summer and the mixing-enhanced algorithm for summer steady stratification and fall overturn periods. There are no evident differences in the simulated thermocline depths using different light extinction algorithms or the observation. Finally, for lake ice phenology, a constant snow density at around 110 kg m<sup>-3</sup>&nbsp;is found to be sufficient for most northern lakes while the Arctic lakes require a higher value. Our study provides highly practical guides for improving 1-D lake models and feasible parameterization strategies to better simulate global lake thermal regimes.</p>","eaps, global lake thermal dynamics, lake model, model intercomparison","Mingyang Guo, Qianlai Zhuang, Huaxia Yao, Malgorzata Golub, L.

The majority of the drying in spray-dryers occurs during the initial phase, where the feed is still liquid. Drying kinetics are very sensitive to the droplet size, and the droplet size is heavily influenced by collisions that can coalesce or split droplets. Droplet collision dynamics are implemented into an Eulerian-Lagrangian framework, where droplets are tracked in the Lagrangian frame, and the background gas is modeled as a continuum. The collision dynamics is capable of predicting the outcome of collisions based on a regime map constructed from the experimental data from the literature. The relative velocity and the Weber number between colliding droplets affect whether droplets coalesce or split into satellite droplets. The modeling framework includes fully coupled interphase heat transfer between the droplet and gas phases. The analytical and numerical models are then used to analyze a simplified pseudo-1D spray system. The results show a linear relationship between the Weber number and the evaporation rate at low droplet number densities. However,&nbsp;it is shown that at high droplet number densities, the relationship between the evaporation rate and the Weber number becomes non-linear, and at extremely high droplet number densities, the evaporation rate decreases even at high Weber numbers.</p>

<p>In the dataset, &quot;NC&quot; is the &quot;no collision&quot; model which does not take into account the collision of droplets and lets them pass through each other. This model provides a benchmark case.

Until recently, traditional watershed algorithms assumed these depressions to be errors in the elevation data and filled them as a means of correction, when, in reality, many of these features may rarely fill and have the potential to dramatically affect surface flow patterns. These depressions play an important role in hydrology, water management, site planning, and  agronomy.</p>
<p>An optimized sequential depression-filling algorithm (sdfa) was developed which fills these water-holding features sequentially based on their respective retention capacity and contributing area.

A performant algorithm is integral to future delivery and utilization by practitioners both in the office and in the field.

The treatments consist of one native prairie mixture and eleven treatments representing common cropping systems in the Midwest United States. For a brief description of WQFS treatments, see Welikhe et al. (2020). The data included here are tile discharge, dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) concentrations and loads for selected plots in the <em>Miscanthus x giganteus</em> (<strong>Mxg</strong>), continuous maize with residue removal (<strong>CM-RR</strong>), and switchgrass variety Shawnee (<strong>Switch</strong>) treatments only (water year 2011 &ndash; 2013, each water year beginning on October 1 and ending on September 30). These treatments were last tilled in 2006 (<strong>Switch</strong>) or 2007 (<strong>Mxg</strong> and <strong>CM-RR</strong>) and had various phosphorus (P) applications over the years. Since 1997, <strong>CM-RR</strong> received approximately 10-gal acre<sup>-1 </sup>of liquid starter fertilizer (17-17-0 [17% (w/w) N and 17% (w/w) P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>] in 1997 and 19-17-0 [17% (w/w) N and 17% (w/w) P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>] every year after) supplying 16 kg P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> with all maize plantings. Also, in April 2012, replicates in the treatment received 43 kg P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>ha<sup>-1 </sup>from a 0-45-0 fertilizer application. Similar liquid starter fertilizer applications were done with all maize plantings prior to treatment conversion to <strong>Mxg</strong> and <strong>Switch</strong> in 2008 and 2007, respectively. All P fertilizer applications were based on Purdue University recommended rates that are dependent on soil test P levels (Vitosh et al. 1995). During the monitoring period, soil samples were obtained in the 0-20 cm layer and were sent to A&amp;L Great Lakes Soil Testing Laboratory, Fort Wayne IN (<a href=""https://algreatlakes.com/"">https://algreatlakes.com/</a>) where, routine chemical characterizations of samples was done. For detailed descriptions of the chemical characterizations, see Welikhe et al. (2020). The individual replicate Soil P Storage Capacity (SPSC) values used to identify a plot&rsquo;s P status were determined as described in Welikhe et al. (2020). The data included here are for plots that consistently had either negative SPSC values (P saturated referred to as P source soils in this work) or postive SPSC values (P unsaturated referred to as P sink soils in this work) throughout the monitoring period. Each of the 48 WQFS treatment plots contains a large in-ground drainage lysimeter (24 x 9 m) constructed as bottomless box with bentonite slurry walls extending to glacial till (1.5 m). Two, parallel plastic tiles (0.1 diameter) are installed in the longitudinal centers of the plots at 0.9 m below the soil surface. A collection tile only drains areas within each lysimeter while a companion tile drains plot area outside the lysimeter. Collection tiles drain into instrumentation huts where calibrated tipping buckets quantify drain flow volumes for each lysimeter. Data loggers automatically record the number of tips per bucket by the hour. Hourly tip counts are converted to discharge volumes using calibration values unique to each tipping bucket. In our study, hourly discharge data were aggregated from noon to noon to create daily discharge data. A statistical protocol and decision rule developed by Trybula (2012) was used to identify and eliminate non-functioning tiles from further analysis. Based on these criteria, plot 22 and 23 of treatment <strong>Mxg</strong> and <strong>CM-RR</strong>, respectively, were eliminated from the rest of the study. Flow-proportional water samples were retrieved daily during flow events and were immediately transported to the laboratory, filtered (0.45 &micro;m filter), and filtrate DRP (orthophosphate) concentrations were analyzed colorimetrically by the Murphy and Riley (1962) procedure using a SEAL AQ2 auto-analyzer method EPA-118-A Rev.5 (equivalent to USEPA method 365.1, Rev.2.0) (SEAL Analytical, 2004). Any samples not analyzed within 24 hours, were frozen.

Overall abundance of midges decreased in the dry season with little differences in abundance of species.","<p>In the tropics, precipitation patterns result in seasonal fluctuations in the abundance and distribution of plant and animal species. Tropical predators and parasites are therefore faced with seasonal changes in prey and host availability. This study investigates the seasonal interaction among a specialised ectoparasite, eavesdropping frog‐biting midges (Corethrella spp.), and their anuran hosts, examining how the abundance and diversity of the frog‐biting midge community fluctuate between the rainy (host abundant) and dry (host sparse) seasons. Midges were captured in both the rainy and dry seasons using acoustic playbacks of calls from a common frog species that breeds during the rainy season, the t&uacute;ngara frog (Engystomops, Physalaemus, pustulosus). During the dry season t&uacute;ngara frog choruses are absent. To explore seasonal shifts in host preference or changes in the midge community due to host specificity, midges were also captured using playbacks of calls from a frog that breeds during the dry season, the pug‐nosed tree frog (Smilisca sila). While the overall abundance of midges decreased in the dry season, only slight differences in the relative abundance between midge species were found. These results suggest that midge populations can shift between hosts as they become available across seasons, allowing adult populations of frog‐biting midges to persist year‐round. To overcome the challenge of detecting and localising different host species, it is proposed that frog‐biting midges have evolved a generalised acoustic template, allowing them to respond to a broad range of available hosts, regardless of seasonal host composition.</p>","acoustic communication, biological sciences, eavesdroppers, engystomops pustulosus, frog-biting midges, phenology, smilisca sila, tropical seasonality","Viktor Baranov, Henry D Legett, Ximena E Bernal"

Our results show that synchronization reduces exposure to eavesdroppers and relaxed selection by females is likely important.","<p>Conspicuous mating signals attract mates but also expose signallers to predators and parasites. Signal evolution, therefore, is driven by conflicting selective pressures from multiple receivers, both target and non-target. Synchronization of mating signals, for example, is an evolutionary puzzle, given the assumed high cost of reduced female attraction when signals overlap. Synchronization may be beneficial, however, if overlapping signals reduce attraction of non-target receivers. We investigate how signal synchronization is shaped by the trade-off between natural and sexual selection in two anuran species: pug-nosed tree frogs (<i>Smilisca sila</i>), in which males produce mating calls in near-perfect synchrony, and t&uacute;ngara frogs (<i>Engystomops pustulosus</i>), in which males alternate their calls. To examine the trade-off imposed by signal synchronization, we conducted field and laboratory playback experiments on eavesdropping enemies (bats and midges) and target receivers (female frogs). Our results suggest that, while synchronization can be a general strategy for signallers to reduce their exposure to eavesdroppers, relaxed selection by females for unsynchronized calls is key to the evolution and maintenance of signal synchrony. This study highlights the role of relaxed selection in our understanding of the origin of mating signals and displays.</p>","acoustic communication, biological sciences, communi, eavesdroppers, relaxed selection, synchrony","Rachel A Page, Henry Legett, Ximena E Bernal"

Signals, however, can also expose signalers to nontarget receivers, including predators and parasites, and thus have also evolved to decrease enemy attraction. Here we show that male tree frogs (<i>Smilisca sila</i>) reduce their attractiveness to eavesdropping enemies (bats and midges) by overlapping their calls at near-perfect synchrony with the calls of neighboring conspecifics. By producing calls that closely follow those of other males, synchronizing&nbsp;<i>S. sila</i>&nbsp;take advantage of an auditory illusion where enemies are more attracted to the leading call. Female&nbsp;<i>S. sila</i>, however, are less susceptible to this illusion. Thus, synchronization among signaling males can result in acoustic crypsis from predators without affecting female attraction.

This noise affected signal types in different ways suggesting some social functions will be disrupted more than others.","<p>Acoustic noise from automobile traffic impedes communication between signaling animals. To overcome the acoustic interference imposed by anthropogenic noise, species across taxa adjust their signaling behavior to increase signal saliency. As most of the spectral energy of anthropogenic noise is concentrated at low acoustic frequencies, species with lower frequency signals are expected to be more affected. Thus, species with low‐frequency signals are under stronger pressure to adjust their signaling behaviors to avoid auditory masking than species with higher frequency signals. Similarly, for a species with multiple types of signals that differ in spectral characteristics, different signal types are expected to be differentially masked. We investigate how the different call types of a Japanese stream breeding treefrog (<i>Buergeria japonica</i>) are affected by automobile traffic noise. Male&nbsp;<i>B.&nbsp;japonica</i>&nbsp;produce two call types that differ in their spectral elements, a Type I call with lower dominant frequency and a Type II call with higher dominant frequency. In response to acoustic playbacks of traffic noise,&nbsp;<i>B.&nbsp;japonica</i>&nbsp;reduced the duration of their Type I calls, but not Type II calls. In addition,&nbsp;<i>B.&nbsp;japonica</i>&nbsp;increased the call effort of their Type I calls and decreased the call effort of their Type II calls. This result contrasts with prior studies in other taxa, which suggest that signalers may switch to higher frequency signal types in response to traffic noise. Furthermore, the increase in Type I call effort was only a short‐term response to noise, while reduced Type II call effort persisted after the playbacks had ended. Overall, such differential effects on signal types suggest that some social functions will be disrupted more than others.

We found no support for the motion dazzle effect as striped crickets did not fare better than solid colored ones crickets that moved more were more likely to be eaten.","<p>Predators everywhere impose strong selection pressures on the morphology and behavior of their prey, but the resulting antipredator adaptations vary greatly among species. Studies of adaptive coloration in prey species have generally focused on cryptic or aposematic prey, with little consideration of color patterns in palatable mobile prey. Complex color patterns have been proposed to decrease the ability of visual predators to capture moving prey (motion dazzle effect). Most support for this hypothesis, however, comes from experiments with human subjects and simulated prey. We tested the motion dazzle effect using, for the first time, natural predators (cane toads, Rhinella marina) and live prey (house crickets, Acheta domesticus) with altered color patterns. We found no support for the motion dazzle effect as striped crickets did not fare better than solid colored ones. Crickets that spent more time moving, however, were more likely to be eaten. Our results suggest that motion specialized visual predators such as toads overcome the motion dazzle effect and impose stronger selection pressure on prey behavior than on coloration. These findings emphasize the importance of sensory specializations of predators in mediating antipredator strategies.</p>","antipredator, biological sciences, camouflage, cane toads, coloration, motion dazzle","Sara Zlotnik, Ximena E Bernal, Geena M Darnell"

Few studies of endocrine disruption, however, focus on secondary sexual traits that affect mating signals, despite their importance for reproductive success. The larynx of many anurans (frogs and toads), for example, is larger in males than in females and is crucial for producing mating calls. We aim to determine if wild populations of cane toads (<i>Rhinella marina</i>) near sugarcane fields in Florida have demasculinized larynges when compared to populations near urban areas. We find evidence of demasculinization in both primary and secondary sexual traits in male toads living near sugarcane. Relative to body size, the laryngeal mass, vocal cord length, and dilator muscle width are all reduced in males from sugarcane regions compared to their urban counterparts. Strong correlations between primary and secondary male sexual traits indicate that demasculinization occurs in concert both within and across diverse organs, including the testes, larynx, and skin. Our results show that anurans near sugarcane fields have demasculinized reproductive systems, that this disruption extends to secondary sexual traits like the larynx, and that it is likely due to anthropogenic causes.</p>","agriculture, biological sciences, cane toads, ecophysiology, endocrine disruptor, vocal cords","Sara Zlotnik, Ximena E Bernal, Marcos Gridi-Papp"

Such signal timing usually falls into general patterns within these aggregations, which can be categorized based on the amount of overlap between the signals.

In contrast, individuals in some species produce signals in synchrony, maximizing overlap and interference. The prevalence and function of signal synchronization is still unknown in many species.

Moreover, existing coinfection studies typically focus on infection outcomes associated with exposure to distinct sets of parasite species, despite that functionally and morphologically similar parasite species commonly coexist in nature.

Surveys at seven ponds in northwest Pennsylvania found that multiple species of echinostomes commonly co-occur. Using a larval anuran host (Rana pipiens) and the two most commonly identified echinostome species from our field surveys (Echinostoma trivolvis and Echinoparyphium lineage 3), we examined how species composition and timing of exposure affect patterns of infection. When tadpoles were exposed to both parasites simultaneously, infection loads were higher than when exposed to Echinoparyphium alone but similar to being exposed to Echinostoma alone. When tadpoles were sequentially exposed to the parasite species, tadpoles first exposed to Echinoparyphium had 23% lower infection loads than tadpoles first exposed to Echinostoma.

Acute toxicity studies are a first step towards understanding responses to PFAS exposure, providing benchmarks for species-specific tolerances, informing ecological risk assessment (ERA), and designing chronic toxicity studies. We conducted standardized 96-h lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) toxicity tests for perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) with nine widely-distributed amphibian species native to eastern and central North America. We also conducted LC<sub>50</sub>&nbsp;tests with perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) for two species and determined whether toxicity of PFOS and PFOA varied between life stages for three species. Acute toxicity varied among PFAS and species and between developmental stages within species. Across all species, toxicity of PFOS was &gt;8&acute;&nbsp;higher than PFOA. Salamanders in the genus&nbsp;<i>Ambystoma</i>&nbsp;were generally more sensitive to PFOS than anurans (frogs and a toad). Toxicity of PFOA was highest for Small-mouthed Salamanders and Gray Tree Frogs and lowest for Jefferson Salamanders, American Bullfrogs, Green Frogs, and Wood Frogs. Although only two species were exposed to PFHxS, survival was lower for Green Frogs than American Bullfrogs. Toxicity of PFAS also varied between developmental stages of larvae. Gray Tree Frogs were more sensitive at later developmental stages and Small-mouthed Salamanders were more sensitive at earlier developmental stages. Our study is one of the first to report species-, developmental stage-, and compound-specific differences in sensitivity to PFAS across a wide range of amphibian species.

Using this study system, we explored patterns of variation in susceptibility to parasites associated with a population&rsquo;s proximity to agriculture (a proxy for pesticide tolerance), and how these patterns are influenced by experimental exposure of tadpoles to the insecticide carbaryl. We did this by first placing tadpoles in an environment containing the pesticide carbaryl (1 mg/L) or in a pesticide-free control environment for 5 d, and subsequently exposing tadpoles to trematodes (<em>Echinostoma trivolvis</em>) or ranavirus (Frog Virus 3).</li>

	<li>Surprisingly, exposure to carbaryl increased the survival rates of tadpoles infected with ranavirus. This was the only significant effect of carbaryl exposure on the measured disease outcomes.</li>
	<li>This study provides evidence for a potential trade-off between trematode resistance and putative pesticide tolerance. Moreover, we show that host populations can vary significantly in their susceptibility to pathogens, but that pesticide exposure does not always increase parasite susceptibility or uniformly exacerbate disease outcomes. Further research is needed to determine how genetic variation among populations impact susceptibility to parasites, and if these patterns of susceptibility are consistent across space and time.</li>

MATLAB code for a method that quantifies the strength of the feedback signal.  Spreadsheet data containing categorical feedback ratings from human listeners.","<p>Hearing aids are commonly fit with ear canals partially or fully open &ndash; a condition that increases the risk of acoustic feedback. &nbsp;Feedback limits the audiometric fitting range of devices by limiting usable gain. &nbsp;To guide clinical decision-making and device selection, we developed the Peak Height Insertion Gain (PHIG) method to detect feedback spikes in the short-term insertion gain derived from audio recordings.&nbsp; Using a manikin, 145 audio recordings of a speech signal were obtained from seven hearing aids. &nbsp;Each hearing aid was programmed for a moderate high-frequency hearing loss with systematic variations in frequency response, gain, and feedback suppression; this created audio recordings that varied the presence and strength of feedback. &nbsp;Using subjective ratings from 13 expert judges, the presence of feedback was determined and then classified according to its temporal and tonal qualities.&nbsp; These classifications were used to optimize parameters for two versions of the PHIG method based on global and local analyses.&nbsp; When specificity was fixed at 0.95, the sensitivity of the global analysis was 0.86 and increased to 0.95 when combined with the local analysis.&nbsp; Without compromising performance, a clinically expedient version of the PHIG method can be obtained using only a single measurement.</p>

To address this goal, we need a greater emphasis on: 1) quantifying pathogen-mediated effects on community structure to enable comparisons with predator-mediated effects and 2) determining the interactive effects of combined natural enemies on communities. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to assess the individual and combined effects of predators (dragonfly larvae and adult water bugs) and a pathogen (ranavirus) on the abundance and composition of a larval amphibian assemblage. We found that our three natural enemies structured communities in unique ways, producing distinct assemblages. Additionally, we found that in combination treatments, predators dominated the influence of virus, resulting in assemblages most closely resembling their respective predator treatments. We also found that predators reduced infection prevalence in combination treatments, and that the magnitude of this effect was dependent on predator identity. Compared to virus-alone treatments, the presence of dragonflies and water bugs reduced infection prevalence by 79% and 63%, respectively. Additionally, the presence of dragonflies eliminated ranavirus infection in two species, which demonstrates the important role of predators in disease dynamics in this system. Overall, this work demonstrates the importance of considering natural enemies in a community context, as each enemy can elicit a unique structural change. Additionally, this study provides a unique empirical test of the healthy herds hypothesis at the community level and underscores the importance of advancing our understanding of multi-enemy interactions within communities.&nbsp;</p>","community composition, community ecology, disease ecology, forestry and natural resources, healthy herds, parasite-induced vulnerability, predator ecology, risk reduction","Jason T.

More specifically, induced pesticide tolerance, in which populations exposed to a contaminant show increased tolerance to the contaminants later, has been documented in multiple taxa. However, the physiological mechanisms of induced tolerance remain unclear. We hypothesized that induced pesticide tolerance is the result of a generalized stress response based on previous studies showing that both natural stressors and anthropogenic stressors can induce tolerance to pesticides. We tested this hypothesis by first exposing larval wood frogs (<i>Rana sylvatica</i>) to either an anthropogenic stressor (sublethal carbaryl concentration), a natural stressor (cues from a caged predator), or a simulated stressor via exogenous exposure to the stress hormone corticosterone (125&thinsp;nM). We also included treatments that inhibited corticosterone synthesis with the compound metyrapone (MTP). We then exposed the larvae to a lethal carbaryl treatment to assess time to death. We found that prior exposure to 125&thinsp;nM of exogenous CORT and predator cues induced tolerance to a lethal concentration of carbaryl through a slight delay in time to death. Pre-exposure to sublethal carbaryl, as well as MTP alone or in combination with predator cues, did not induce tolerance to the lethal carbaryl concentration relative to the ethanol vehicle control treatment. Our study provides evidence that pesticide tolerance can be induced by a generalized stress response both in the presence and absence (exogenous CORT) of specific cues and highlights the importance of considering physiological ecology and environmental context in ecotoxicology.</p>","acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, amphibians, carbaryl, forestry and natural resources, frogs, generalized stress response, glucocorticoids, inducible tolerance, rana sylvatica","Jason T.

<p>The original or modified Rayleigh Plesset equation (RPE) is often used to analyze cavitation bubble dynamics. The prediction accuracy of these equations is governed by the initial values of the physical parameters. However, even for higher fidelity models, deviations from experimental measurements are observed due to the models&#39; underlying assumptions. Here, we present a novel state-observer data-assimilation technique designed to fuse time-resolved cavitation bubble diameter measurements with a governing model to yield enhanced Spatio-temporal prediction of the cavitation bubble dynamics. This technique places an observer variable in the original or modified RPE and uses a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control law on the difference between the predicted and measured cavitation bubble diameter. The data-assimilated modeling most accurately estimates the bubble diameter and far-field pressure as the deviation of bubble diameter and far-field pressure predictions from measurements decrease by up to 90% and 60%, respectively. Although the assimilated model is not a substitute for high fidelity models, this technique overcomes the inherent model assumptions and makes the model&rsquo;s outputs more robust with respect to the physical parameters&#39; initial values. &nbsp;</p>

We found that synchronized signalling both increasing attraction of females to the chorus and reducing eavesdropper attacks.","<p>In dense mating aggregations, such as leks and choruses, acoustic signals produced by competing male conspecifics often overlap in time. When signals overlap at a fine temporal scale, either completely or partially, the ability of females to discriminate between individual signals is reduced. Yet, despite this cost, males of some species produce calls that closely follow those of conspecifics, synchronizing signal production by deliberately overlapping their signals. Here, we investigate two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses of synchronized mating signals in a Japanese stream-breeding treefrog (Buergeria japonica): 1) increased female attraction to the chorus through acoustic constructive interference (the beacon effect hypothesis) and 2) reduced attraction of eavesdropping predators through perceptual manipulation (the eavesdropper avoidance hypothesis). Our results from field playback experiments on female frogs and eavesdropping micropredators (midges and mosquitoes) support both hypotheses. Signal transmission and female phonotaxis experiments suggest that synchronized calls are more attractive to females at a distance than unsynchronized calls. At the chorus, however, eavesdroppers are less attracted to calls that closely follow an initial call, while female attraction to individual signals is not affected. Therefore, synchronized signalling likely benefits male B. japonica by both increasing attraction of females to the chorus and reducing eavesdropper attacks. These findings highlight the complex nature of signal synchronization and how multiple interacting selective pressures likely promoted the evolution and maintenance of this behaviour.</p>","acoustic communication, beacon effect, biological sciences, eavesdroppers, predator avoidance, relaxed selection, synchrony","Henry Legett, Ikkyu Aihara, Ximena E Bernal"

Plant surveys conducted in 2018 following restoration in 2016.","<p>The main objective of plant community restoration is often to return an ecosystem to its historic successional trajectory. It can also be the result of other restoration, as was the case at Salomon Farm Park, Indiana where a ditch was moved to add sinuosity and reduce flooding. This construction activity created in a field being heavily disturbed and, subsequently, native plant seeds were sown in 2016. In 2018, we surveyed the restored field and an adjacent control field without disturbance. Species richness did not differ between the fields, but non-native and overall species diversity was greater in the restoration field. In the control field, abundance was dominated by <em>Poa pratensis </em>accounting for 74% of the individuals. In the restoration field, abundance was much more evenly distributed between the species. Less than a third of the species were shared between the restoration field and the control, and even fewer species were shared between the applied seed mix and the restoration field. The restoration effort at Salomon Farm Park produced disturbance that facilitated colonization of plants from surrounding communities, including increased evenness in non-native species. Sowing seeds may be effective in establishing plant communities in certain ecosystems, but allowing time for colonization may be just as important.</p>","biology, ecological applications, ecology, plant diversity, plant survey, restoration","Jordan M Marshall"

The flow of water carved out a geographically unique passage in the landscape, the variance in terrain creating subsequent diversity of flora. The site is protected by ACRES Land Trust within the Little River watershed. To ensure a better understanding of the community structure, ecological and floristic surveys were conducted between April and October of 2019. The ecological survey consisted of 48 quadrats along 7 transects visited in May, July, and September, and included identifying understory, midstory, and overstory plant species. Additionally, we measured PAR, canopy cover, litter depth, and soil moisture in each quadrat. The floristic survey was done to catalogue all species and conducted in a non-random meander between the set transects, in order to ensure inclusion of community types and terrain gradation potentially omitted in the ecological survey. At the quadrat level, understory species richness was significantly related to the canopy cover for all three surveyed months. However, understory species diversity was related to the litter depth in May, and canopy cover in July and September. As expected for the region, swamp white oak was a dominant overstory species, especially in the lower areas of the property. Unexpected was the dominance of black walnut throughout large areas of the property &ndash; occurring in the greatest proportion of quadrats and at the greatest density. LWRNP is an excellent example of the diversity that can exist in a small, protected forest. While there are some common invasive species in need of control within the property, there are more interesting native species as well, adding diversity and interest to the community. Further management may be necessary by ACRES Land Trust to ensure continued succession dominated by native species.</p>","allen county, biology, ecology, indiana, nature preserve, plant diversity, plant survey","Jordan M Marshall"

Images were collected from June 2016 through April 2017.","<p>To understand how riparian (stream side) tree canopy cover controls light availability in river networks, we collected hemispherical photographs of tree canopy cover of rivers and streams through the Connecticut River watershed. Data collection occurred primarily in the Farmington River watershed in Connecticut and the Passumpsic River watershed in Vermont, two 5<sup>th</sup> order tributaries of the Connecticut River. These results have been used in a published study of the response to the Connecticut River to drought conditions by Hosen et al. (<a aria-label=""Digital Object Identifier"" class=""epub-doi"" href=""https://doi.org/10.1002/lno.11127"">https://doi.org/10.1002/lno.11127</a>) with additional publications pending.</p>

<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>

<p><em>Field Methods</em></p>

<p>Leaf-on data was collected from June 2016 through September 2016. We used a Kodak PixPro SP360 camera to capture hemispherical images of riparian canopy for each site (Figure 1).</p>

<p>Once we arrived at a site, we used a random number generator to determine our sampling location within a 100-meter range upstream or downstream of the stream point of access. For forested and agricultural sites, a 10-meter buffer was mandated, at minimum, to ensure that areas cleared for roads or trails did not impact light penetration results.</p>

<p>When the sampling site was identified, we transected the stream. Three images were taken per sampling site&mdash;one per bank, and one in the due center of streamflow. The camera was consistently balanced 15 to 45 centimeters above the water for each image, with a 30- to 45- centimeter range for most sites. An identifying mark on the camera mount was oriented due south in each photo for replicability.</p>

<p>A subset of leaf-off data was collected from December 2016 through April 2017 (n=20). Twelve sites located were in the Farmington River watershed and eight in the Passumpsic.</p>

<p><em>Photo Preparation and Canopy Cover Estimation</em></p>

<p>Photos were processed using SideLook 1.1.01 with automatic threshold detection (Nobis and Hunziker 2005). White pixels indicated light penetration and black pixels indicated canopy cover, riparian structures, or ground cover. When visual assessment indicated that automatic threshold results did not correctly sort pixels, we used the &ldquo;set frame&rdquo; feature to manually correct the image.</p>

<p>After processing, photos were analyzed using standard protocols for CIMES canopy cover analysis software (Gonsamo et al. 2011).</p>

The temporal dynamics of invasions vary tremendously and are often difficult to characterize but can provide key insights into patterns of establishment and spread of introduced species. Herein, we reconstructed the invasion history of two amphibians that are of ecological concern in Florida, the cane toad (<em>Rhinella marina</em>) and Cuban treefrog (<em>Osteopilus septentrionalis</em>). We analyzed publicly available datasets using deterministic spatial interpolation to quantify the range expansion of both species within Florida since their establishment. We found that both species were restricted to small geographic regions of Florida until about 1990, when they increased their rate of spread due at least in part to multiple transplantation events. Since 1990, both species have undergone sharp range increases that may be due to increased recruitment and landscape disturbances caused by Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Presently, the expansion rate of the cane toad shows initial signs of slowing while the Cuban treefrog continues to grow at an exponential rate of increase. Our results highlight the commonalities and differences in range expansion between anuran species with disparate natural history strategies. Short generation time and high fecundity, in combination with disturbances caused by hurricanes, appear to have fueled both species&rsquo; invasions. By comparing invasion histories across species, we can begin to understand the drivers that may influence anuran invasions, including historical events, climate, habitat availability and life history characteristics.</p>","biological sciences, invasion, invasive species, r software, spatial ecology","James Andrew DeWoody, Andrew Joseph Mularo, Ximena E Bernal"
"2837","3742","10.4231/K2MY-AV11","Transport Amphoras at the Anamur Archaeological Museum","This dataset contains processed data for 150 ancient transport amphoras stored at the Anamur Archaeological Museum. The jars date from the Early Iron Age to the Early Modern Era.","<p>This dataset contains processed data for 150 ancient transport amphoras stored at the Anamur Archaeological Museum dating from the Early Iron Age to the Early Modern Era. Most jars are represented by photographs, a profile drawing, fabric photographs obtained with a digital microscope, a detailed form description, measurements, a Munsell fabric coloration, commentary,&nbsp;and bibliographical citations of comparanda. To maintain&nbsp; consistency&nbsp; with museum records at the Anamur Museum, we adhere to the Inventory Numbers of the&nbsp;museum as our means of organizing the amphora catalogue. The inventory numbers typically record the date of acquisition by the museum and appear as numbers representing the day, month, and year of acquisition.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
At the invitation of the (late) museum director, Ramazan Peker, Nicholas Rauh (Purdue University) and Matthew Dillon (Loyola Marymount University) obtained permission from the General Directorate of Monuments and Museums, Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism in 2007 to publish a catalogue of the ancient transport amphoras stored in the Anamur Museum. Rauh and Dillon processed approximately 130 amphoras during a sabbatical leave in 2007. Most of the jars had been acquired by the museum beginning in the 1990s from fishermen who caught them in their nets. The provenance for the majority of the jars in this collection, accordingly, can be defined as the waters of the Mediterranean Sea near Anamur. While studying the amphoras, it became clear to Rauh and Dillon that many of the forms originated from excavated materials obtained from the nearby site of Kelenderis. The excavation&nbsp;project there has been&nbsp;directed by Dr. Prof. Levent Zoroğlu (formerly of Selcuk University in Konya, Turkey). Zoroğlu made a point of assembling artifacts identifiably originating from Kelenderis at the Anamur Museum, prior to the installation of his own excavation depot at Aydıncık. Rauh and Dillon discussed the matter with Professor Zoroğlu and it was agreed by all that we would publish the Anamur Amphora Collection as a whole while recognizing Professor Zoroğlu&#39;s important contributions from Kelenderis.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Project went into hiatus for several years until Rauh returned to Anamur with Caroline Autret in 2012 to begin the process of drafting profile drawings of representative forms. Autret trained Rauh, Dillon, and numerous students to generate these time-consuming drawings. From 2012 until 2018, Rauh briefly returned to Anamur&nbsp;every summer to continue with the drawing effort. In addition to the continued assistance of Autret (2012-2017) and Dillon (2013-2014), Rauh recruited the services of Dr. Asena Kızılarslanoğlu now at Kastamonu University in Turkey (2015-2018). He also recruited the help of numerous students from the USA, including several students from St. Olaf&#39;s College (who initially visited the museum with their professor, Tim Howe), Joseph Rynasko, Brian Stroinski, Morgan Wychor, and Clair Yancey; Purdue students, Lauren Dalicandro, Elijah Morris, Adam Freeburg, and Nathan McBurnett; Emily Getz from Indiana University; and Fernando Madrigal from Loyola Marymount University. With so many hands on deck, the&nbsp; team was able to generate profile drawings for approximately 120 of the amphoras in the collection. Under the direction of Joe Rynasko and Matt Konkoly, the students from Rauh&#39;s Pottery Seminar at Purdue (Sam Bakeis, Trevor Billings, Chris Buntin, Abby Craig, Anand Griffith, Lily Peck, and Anna Wiljer) assisted with the inking of the profile drawings.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
During the course of these seven season (2012-2018), two additional developments affected the progress of our research. The first of these was the determination that the Anamur Archaeological Museum building was structurally unsound, forcing the museum authorities to close the museum in 2016, and to move its antiquities to an off-site depot. The amphoras were initially relocated to the museum exhibit hall so that we could continue to work with them. However, by 2018 it became clear that several undrawn amphoras were no longer present in the museum and were presumably relocated to the off-site depot. This development prompted Rauh to conclude the on-site portion of the work and to focus on generating a catalogue based on the work completed by 2018.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A second development arose from the fact that amphoras continued to be acquired by the museum after our initial investigation in 2007. Since our primary objective after 2012 was to draw amphoras, the team decided to draw these new jars and to obtain a minimal description of each amphora in the time available. The records for several amphoras studied after 2012 are accordingly partially complete, yet, valuable for the additional forms that they contribute to the collection. These limitations notwithstanding, with the assistance of Stanislav Pej&scaron;a of Purdue University Libraries, Joe&nbsp; Rynasko (M.A. in Museum Studies, Glasgow University), and Purdue student Matthew Konkoly, we publish our findings at the Purdue Digital Research Repository (PURR). It is our expectation that this valuable trove of amphora data will shed important new light on ancient trading patterns along the south Anatolian coast.<br />

From these samples, we identified 623 MRMs belonging to 10 lipid classes (sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, free fatty acids, cholesteryl esters, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, ceramides, and triacylglycerides) and one metabolite group (acyl-carnitines) present in sea turtle plasma. The relative ion intensities of most lipids (80%) were consistent between species, across seasons, and were not correlated to body size or estimated sex. Of the differences we observed, the most pronounced was the differences in relative ion intensity between species. We identified 114 lipids that had species-specific relative ion intensities. While some of this variability is likely due to green and hawksbill turtles consuming different food items, we found indications of a phylogenetic component as well. In addition, we identified 46 lipids that varied by season, most belonging to the structural phospholipid classes. Overall, more lipids (n = 27) had higher relative ion intensity in the upwelling (colder) season compared to the non-upwelling season (n = 6). Further, we found more variability in hawksbill turtles than green turtles.&nbsp;</p>","chelonia myda, eretmochelys imbricata, forestry and natural resources, lipid profiles, mass spectrometry, mrm-profiling","Frank Paladino, Chelsea E.

While these factors have been well-studied individually, the experimental designs do not reflect real-world conditions where insecticide exposure and lack of forage occur simultaneously and could interactively suppress pollinator health. Using outdoor enclosures, we tested the effects of insecticides (imidacloprid + lambda-cyhalothrin) and non-crop forage (clover) in a factorial design, measuring the survival, behavior, and performance of bumble bees (<em>Bombus impatiens</em>), as well as pollination of the focal crop, watermelon. Colony survival was synergistically reduced to 17% in watermelon alone + insecticides (survival was 100% in all other treatments). However, behavioral shifts in foraging were mainly due to insecticides (e.g., 95% reduced visitation rate to watermelon flowers), while impacts on hive performance were primarily driven by clover presence (e.g., 374% increase in number of live eggs). Insecticide-mediated reductions in foraging decreased crop pollination (fruit set) by 32%. Altogether, these data indicate that both insecticides and non-crop forage play integral roles in shaping pollinator health in agricultural landscapes, but the relative importance and interaction of these two factors depend on which aspect of &ldquo;health&rdquo; are most valued.</p>","entomology, high tunnel production systems, pesticides, pollinators","Ian Kaplan"

Displacement uncertainty quantification algorithms from cross-correlation-based particle image velocimetry are used to estimate the uncertainty in the dot pattern displacements obtained from cross-correlation for BOSs and assess their feasibility. In order to propagate the displacement uncertainty through the density integration procedure, we also develop a novel methodology via the Poisson solver using sparse linear operators. Testing the method using synthetic images of a Gaussian density field showed agreement between the propagated density uncertainties and the true uncertainty. Subsequently, the methodology is experimentally demonstrated for supersonic flow over a wedge, showing that regions with sharp changes in density lead to an increase in density uncertainty throughout the field of view, even in regions without these sharp changes. The uncertainty propagation is influenced by the density integration scheme, and for the Poisson solver the density uncertainty on average increases on moving away from the regions where the Dirichlet boundary conditions are specified.</p>","aeronautics and astronautics engineering, background oriented schlieren, numerical analysis, python, uncertainty quantification","Jiacheng Zhang, Lalit Rajendran, Sayantan Bhattacharya, Sally P M Bane, Pavlos Vlachos"

<p>The greatest advantages of the technology are the safety enhancement, reduction of driver workload, and efficient application of brine.&nbsp; While operating the vehicle, the driver focuses on brine application, surrounding vehicles and operating the application controls.&nbsp; This system eliminates two of the distractions as the controller informs the driver on brine application and controls the application rate in each area, allowing the driver to focus on maneuvering the vehicle. Additionally, the application files can be programmed to account for areas that experience low-sunlight, higher winds and other weather. Through documentation, it was determined that brine application without the automated technology requires the driver&rsquo;s attention over 600 times on I-465, which can be very distracting/taxing on the driver on a 2-6 lane interstate with high traffic volumes.</p>

Data include soil wet chemistry (pH, EC, carbon, etc), and portable X-ray fluorescence and visible near infrared...","<p>These data are&nbsp;a subset from research conducted by the Soil Health Impairment, and Vulnerability (SHIVA) Team within the Arequipa Nexus Institute. The objective was to test these rapid spectroscopy techniques to quantify elemental content (pXRF) and predict organic carbon content (VNIR).</p>

<p>The data are summarized and analyzed within a manuscript entitled &quot;Soil chemical assessment with portable XRF and VNIR spectroscopy: A case study of irrigated desert Agriculture in Arequipa, Peru&quot;. The abstract explaining methods and objectives in further detail is below.</p>

<p>The expansion of irrigated agriculture into desert systems can rapidly change soil chemistry and require shifts in management to maintain crop production. Interacting soil chemical properties such pH, electrical conductivity (EC), ionic composition, and soil organic carbon (OC), can all influence crop yield, but regular assessment of multiple soil metrics is time and cost intensive. This study evaluates low-cost soil assessment using paired analyses of traditional soil chemical assays (pH, EC, total carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and organic matter) with Visible Near Infrared (VNIR) spectroscopy to predict soil OC and portable X-Ray Fluorescence (pXRF) analysis to quantify additional elemental contents. For an initial case study in the Arequipa region of Peru, surface sandy loam soils (n=83) were sampled from drip irrigated vineyards within the hyperarid Majes District. Additional loamy soils from traditional agricultural fields around the City of Arequipa (AQP, n=29) serve as reference points with higher OC contents. &nbsp;In the desert soils, OC ranged between 0.18-2.31 weight % (averaging 0.79 weight % OC), resulting in initially poor model prediction from VNIR spectra. Therefore, to maximize accuracy of the VNIR partial least squares regression, we included the higher OC soils from AQP. We then determined the optimal pre-processing procedure: an international soil standard correction, a robust baseline correction, multiplicative scatter correction, and Savitzky-Golay smoothing (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.81, RMSE = 0.12 (equivalent to 0.09% OC), RPD = 2.5). We achieved prediction power similar to previous VNIR spectroscopy analyses of low OC soils. For validation of the pXRF method we used the soil standard SRM 2711a. The elements detected with reliable accuracy (80-120% recovery) and precision (coefficient of variation &lt;0.02) were Bi, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ti, and Zn. Patterns in the pXRF data correlated with other soil chemical properties at the site level, particularly with Ca, suggesting interactions with calcium carbonates. Analysis of soil metal content revealed elevated elemental Cr (198 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), probably from a geologic source. Together these initial tests of pXRF and VNIR spectroscopy demonstrate their utility as screening techniques for rapidly changing soil chemistry under different agricultural management strategies and arid land development.</p>","agriculture, arequipa nexus institute, eaps, peru, proximal spectroscopy, soil chemistry, soil health, soil reflectance, visible near infrared, x-ray fluorescence","Sabina Yeasmin, Lucia Zuniga, Zachary Brecheisen, Cliff T Johnston, Darrell G Schulze, Erika J Foster, Abigail Tomasek, Martha Jimenez Castaneda, Walter D.

The endeavor to identify such influences is a complex task that may be approached in a variety of ways. As one way--but certainly not the only way--of engaging this problematic, we devised a quantitative tool entitled &ldquo;Intertexts and Influence: A Comprehensive Table of Intertexts in Philip Roth&rsquo;s Fiction, 1952-2010.&rdquo; Using Roth&rsquo;s 53 novels, novellas, and short stories as a database, our table measures every literary: 1) author, 2) work, 3) character, and, 4) passage/verse invoked in his <em>oeuvre</em>. Our findings are geared toward identifying which figures Roth cited most frequently, and in which of his own works he intensified his rate of intertextual invocation. At the very least, our research tool will help scholars quickly identify when and where Roth cited other writers. At best, it will facilitate the inquiries of those studying Rothian intertextuality--a quality of his fiction which we believe must be recognized as a defining component of his aesthetic.&nbsp;</p>

Fifty-one out of 102 second graders and 90 out of 102 fifth graders read or used negative signs at least once across the 11 problems. Among second graders, one of their most common strategies was subtracting numbers using their absolute values, which aligned with students&rsquo; whole number knowledge-pieces and knowledge-structure. They sometimes preserved the order of numbers and changed the placement of the negative sign (e.g., &minus;9 + 2 as 9 &ndash; 2) and sometimes did the opposite (e.g., &minus;1 + 8 as 8 &ndash; 1). Among fifth graders, one of the most common strategies reflected use of integer knowledge-pieces within a whole-number knowledge-structure, as they added numbers&rsquo; absolute values using whole number addition and appended the negative sign to their total. For both grade levels, the order of the numerals, the location of the negative signs, and also the numbers&rsquo; absolute values in the problems played a role in students&rsquo; strategies used. Fifth graders&rsquo; greater strategy variability often reflected strategic use of the meanings of the minus sign. Our findings provide insights into students&rsquo; problem interpretation and solution strategies for integer addition problems and supports a blended theory of conceptual change. Adding to prior findings, we found that entrenchment of previously learned patterns can be useful in unlikely ways, which should be taken up in instruction. &nbsp;Included here is the data for students reading and using of the negative signs.</p>","curriculum and instruction, dataset, elementary, integer addition, integers, negative signs","Laura C Bofferding, Mahtob Aqazade"

Taken together, these studies reveal a significant metabolic tradeoff between CG biosynthesis and plant growth in sorghum seedlings.</p>

<p>Plant growth and development data from the greenhouse and field trials from this study&nbsp;are available at this site.&nbsp;The files are designated by location and year with locations shown as greenhouse (GH) or field (WL) then the year the study took place.&nbsp;For example, the GH18_insect_data.xlsx includes data from the greenhouse trials in 2018. Within each file there may be multiple sheets that define the type of data collected. Data for green plant area collected with the Aris TopView Phenotyping System, total leaf area, fresh weight, and dry weight are organized by plot, genotype, and insect infestation treatment. Temporal data from the greenhouse trials include time (hours) when measurements was taken, the plant number, and insect infestation treatment.

The addition of these vehicles to the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) market would provide more options for short to medium distance aerial transportation, filling the niche that is currently occupied by helicopters. However, the costs and benefits of adopting these vehicles are reliant on many different factors related to both the aircraft and its operating environment.This paper compares 13 UAM vehicles (12 emerging eVTOL vehicles and one helicopter) using a Direct Operating Cost (DOC) model developed by the authors. With the computed DOC values for each vehicle, a computational framework determines, from a set of known passenger trips in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, the number of passenger trips that would use UAM as part of the total trip. These assessments use a specific network of aerodromes in the ChicagoMetropolitan Area using existing sites that could support UAM aircraft operations. From the results, we infer important vehicle characteristics and preferable vehicle configurations for the specific aerodrome network that lead to the highest number of passenger trips utilizing UAM.</p>","advanced air mobility, aeronautics and astronautics engineering, aerospace engineering, aircraft design, aviation, economics, engineering, mobility, technology, transportation, urban air mobility, vertical takeoff and landing","Ryan James Howard, Nicholas I.

However, there is little research exploring whether or to what extent group attitudes influence public opinion on constitutionally guaranteed liberties. For this reason, we seek to shed light on whether the public actually views rights as fundamental, or whether attitudes toward groups &ndash; in this case, racial groups &ndash; moderate attitudes about civil liberties. We use a series of survey experiments to assess whether public support for constitutional protections &ndash; such as those found in the First, Second, and Fifth Amendments &ndash; is contingent on respondents&rsquo; attitudes toward the group identity of those benefiting from these protections. We show that while Americans do hold civil liberties in high esteem, attitudes toward a variety of constitutional rights are significantly conditioned by attitudes toward the group exercising a given right. Our findings indicate a gap between the ideal of civil liberties and what we see in reality, and suggest that racial attitudes may be endangering a core tenet of our political system.</p>","civil liberties, groups, political science, public opinion, race, tolerance","Daniel Bennett, Logan R Strother"

Child version is a subset of word pairs from the adult version within a 5-year old...","<p>Sixty-six minimal pair /s/ and /ʃ/ words were selected, including proper nouns (e.g. Sam to contrast with sham). Forty-five of these pairs had /s/-/ʃ/ in the initial position, eighteen in the final position, and three in the medial position. Six female talkers were recorded speaking these words in with the carrier phrase &ldquo;pick the word ____ now,&rdquo; in order to encourage a natural speaking rate and to discourage emphasizing the /s/-/ʃ/ portion of the word. Native geographical regions of the talkers included the Midwest (Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio), the South (Tennessee), and the Northeast (New Jersey). Recordings were obtained in a sound-treated booth using a Shure model SM48 microphone positioned at a 45-degree angle and 4-5 inches from the talker&rsquo;s mouth. Using a computer outside the booth, Audacity open source software version 2.1.2 was used to record the speech at a rate of 44,100 Hz with 32-bit depth. During recording, slips of paper were printed with each word, and the order was randomized by shuffling the slips. This was done to help avoid the tendency to over-enunciate the difference between the paired set, as might occur if the minimal pair was spoken sequentially. To extract words from the longer phrases, lab assistants used Audacity to examine the time waveform to mark the keyword, and then to listen to it in isolation to further refine their selection. The waveform was then marked at the zero amplitude crossings. These were extracted to an Audacity sound file and saved. Then using similar methods, the start and end time for the contrastive /s/ and /ʃ/ sounds were marked in the Audacity file for later acoustic analysis. For quality control purposes, three lab assistants listened to the recordings individually in order to make judgments about sound quality and naturalness when played in isolation. For a further check of quality control, the assistants listened to word pairs sequentially to ensure that the pronunciation was similar in most respects, except for the /s/ and /ʃ/. Words and word pairs that did not meet this requirement were re-recorded and evaluated again, and if necessary recorded yet again. Keywords and the calibration tone are scaled to equal RMS amplitude (-20 dB full scale). Carrier phrases (&quot;pick the work . . .,&quot; &quot;say the word . . .,&quot; &quot;. . . now&quot; are scaled to the same amplitude as the keywords. Keywords were inserted into the carrier phrases with 50 ms of silence before and after the keyword.</p>

Here, a thermo-kinetic model that&nbsp;takes into account the dissolution and oxidation mode of degradation of the carbon-supported catalysts is considered which&nbsp;serves as an enabler to&nbsp;simulate a cyclic voltammogram (CV) based on a standard durability&nbsp;protocol. The model is implemented in MATLAB employing an ode solver based on the Runge-Kutta algorithm (the pertinent files are named as &quot;CV_model.m&quot; and &quot;CV_function.m&quot;). Two representative protocols or input voltage profiles have been considered - triangular and trapezoidal.

However, insecticides are also necessary for farmers to manage &ldquo;bad&rdquo; insects (i.e., pests) and thus a more holistic view of crop management needs to account for the proper balance between the beneficial and detrimental aspects of pesticides. Here, we used multi-year field experiments with a paired corn-watermelon cropping system to show that insecticide use can be dramatically reduced (by ca. 95%) while maintaining or even increasing yields through the conservation of wild bees as crop pollinators. These data demonstrate that food production and ecosystem sustainability are not necessarily conflicting goals.</p>","agroecosystems, bees, corn, crop yield, entomology, environmental issues, insecticides, melons, pesticides, pollinators","Ian Kaplan, Jacob Pecenka"

Years 2002 to 2004.

The direction and extent of these changes are altered by phosphorus and potassium...","<p>Phosphorus and K impact alfalfa (<em>Medicago sativa</em> L.) performance, but how these nutrients alter taproot physiology during fall acclimation and subsequent growth in spring is unclear. Our objectives were to: 1) determine seasonal patterns for taproot P and K concentrations during fall acclimation, and during initial shoot growth in spring; 2) determine how P and K nutrition impacts accumulation of taproot C and N reserves during fall and their subsequent use when shoot growth resumes in spring; and 3) assess how P and K fertility-driven differences in accumulation and use of C and N reserves impacts survival and shoot growth in spring. Two P (0 and 75 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) and two K (0 and 400 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) treatments were applied roots were sampled between Sep and Dec, and again from Mar to May over two years. Concentrations of taproot sugar, starch, buffer-soluble protein, amino-N, and RNA pools were determined. While P and K fertilizer application increased taproot P and K concentrations two-to three-fold, concentrations of P and K in taproots over time did not change markedly during cold acclimation in autumn, however, taproot P declined in spring as plant growth resumed. Compared to the 0K-0P treatment, taproots of plants fertilized with 400K-75P had higher starch, protein, amino-N, and RNA, but reduced sugar concentrations in autumn. Concentrations of all these pools, except starch, declined during the initial two weeks of sampling beginning in late March as shoot growth resumed in spring. Herbage yield in May was highest for the 400K-75P treatment, and least for the 0K-0P treatment; differences that were associated with variation in mass shoot-1 and not shoots m<sup>-2</sup>. High yield of the 400K-75P plants in May was consistently associated with greater concentrations and use of amino-N, soluble protein, and RNA pools in taproots, and not with accumulation and use of starch and sugar pools. Understanding factors leading to the accumulation of taproot N reserves and RNA during cold acclimation in autumn and their use during the initial growth in spring should enhance efforts to improve alfalfa shoot growth and plant stress tolerance.</p>","agriculture, agronomy, alfalfa, amino acid, growth, medicago, nonstructural carbohydrates, phosphorus fertilizer, plant persistence, potassium fertilizer, protein, roots, shoot growth, starch reserves, sugar reserves, winter hardiness, yield components","W.

Calculations were performed for mean field approximations that include the expectation value of one operator (mean field), two operators (mean field-2), and three operators (mean field-3). For the one-time expectation values, we examined three different situations to understand the convergence with increasing order of mean field and some limitations of higher order mean field&nbsp; approximations. As a representation of a two-time expectation value, we calculated the $g^{(2)}(tau )$ for a line of atoms illuminated by a perpendicular plane wave at several emission angles and two different intensities. For many cases, the mean field-2 will be sufficiently accurate to quantitatively predict the response of the atoms as measured by one-time expectation values.

<p>Foreign-born Latinos over eighteen; contact information obtained from marketing research firms.&nbsp; For further details, see James A. McCann and Michael Jones-Correa, <em>Holding Fast: Resilience and Civic Engagement Among Latino Immigrants</em> (Russell Sage Foundation, 2020).</p>

<p><u>Survey design</u></p>

<p>The first survey wave was administered nationally by telephone to a representative sample (<em>N</em>=1,800).&nbsp; Both cellular and landlines were called.&nbsp; Nearly all interviews were in Spanish, by the respondent&rsquo;s choice.</p>

<p>After the 2016 election, 576 immigrants took part in the second survey wave, which was fielded during the presidential transition period (November 8, 2016 &ndash; January 20, 2021, a 32 percent re-contact rate).&nbsp; At this time, an additional fresh sample of 260 Latino immigrants was added to the study using the same sampling procedures as the first wave.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2017 (July through early-September), a third wave was conducted, with all 1,800 immigrants from the pre-election baseline survey being eligible for interviewing. In this period, 31 percent of these immigrants (<em>N</em>=554) were surveyed; this includes 321 respondents who had taken part in the second wave and 233 who had not.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to these respondents, 500 fresh immigrants were sampled using the same procedures as the first wave.&nbsp; In total, 2,560 immigrants took part in the 2016-17 LINES.</p>

<p><u>AAPOR response rates</u></p>

<p>RR 1 = .034 (pre-election); .020 (post-election transition); .032 (summer of 2017).&nbsp;</p>

<p>COOP 4 = .239 (pre-election); 253 (post-election transition); .296 (summer of 2017).</p>

<p><u>Weighting</u></p>

<p>Distributions of socio-demographic variables were compared to the American Community Survey (ACS).&nbsp; In most respects, the LINES sample conformed to the ACS, though significant discrepancies were found for education, age, gender, and citizenship status.&nbsp; Weighting values were calculated based on these variables through iterative proportional fitting (&ldquo;raking&rdquo;).&nbsp; These values are given in the variable &ldquo;weight.&rdquo;</p>

This study used a revised process-based biogeochemical model to quantify the effects in the region during the 21st century. Permafrost degradation would expose 0.98&plusmn;0.49 (mean&plusmn;SD) and 2.17&plusmn;0.38 Pg C of soil organic carbon under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and the RCP 8.5, respectively. Among them, more than 25% will be decomposed, enhancing heterotrophic respiration by 9.54&plusmn;5.20 (RCP 4.5) and 38.72&plusmn;17.49 (RCP 8.5) Tg C/yr in 2099. Deep soil N supply due to thawing permafrost is not accessible to plants, providing limited benefits to plant growth and only stimulating net primary production by 6.95&plusmn;5.28 (RCP 4.5) and 27.97&plusmn;12.82 (RCP 8.5) Tg C/yr in 2099. As a result, permafrost degradation would weaken the regional C sink (net ecosystem production) by 303.55&plusmn;254.80 (RCP 4.5) and 518.43&plusmn;234.04 (RCP 8.5) Tg C cumulatively during 2020&ndash;2099.</p>

<p>This dataset includes the main results of this study. &nbsp;The Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) was adopted in this study to account for the effects of exposed permafrost C and N to ecosystem C cycling in the permafrost region on the QTP.</p>

<p>TEM was driven with spatially referenced climate data from 2006 to 2099, including air temperature (℃), precipitation (mm), and incident short-wave solar radiation (W/m2). These data were derived from four global circulation models (GCMs: IPSL-CM5A-LR, GFDL-ESM2M, MIROC5, and HadGEM2-ES) in the second simulation round of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP 2b). And the simulation was conducted under two climate scenarios of the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP 4.5) and RCP 8.5, which correspond to radiative forcing levels of 4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100, respectively.</p>

<p class=""Abstract"">To determine the direct effects of ALT deepening on ecosystem C dynamics, we carried out two simulations: <a name=""_Hlk82726211"">the referenced simulation (SR) and the transient simulation (ST)</a>. The two simulations share the same model inputs but have differences in model structure. They are identical until 2020. After that, ALT changes with climate in ST but remains constant in SR. Therefore, C and N pools do not change with ALT in SR after 2020 but are influenced by ALT in ST. Through comparing the results of these two simulations, the direct effects of ALT changes on ecosystem C dynamics can be estimated.</p>","carbon sequestration, climate change, earth and atmospheric sciences, matlab, nitrogen availability, permafrost degradation, qinghai-tibetan plateau","Lei Liu, Qianlai Zhuang, Dongsheng Zhao, Du Zheng, Dan Kou, Yuanhe Yang"

Due to geomorphic alteration of river channels and land-cover change, degradation to floodplain lakes in the Ohio River basin is occurring at a rate that will escalate as climate change causes increased flood intensity and the seasonal redistribution of rainfall. A better understanding of the local drivers that affect oxbow lakes is needed for targeted floodplain restoration efforts designed to slow degradation. We examined the effects of land cover, topography, and hydrologic connectivity on water quality and fish diversity and abundance in nine floodplain lakes with potentially high remnant ecological function in the Wabash-White watershed (Indiana and Illinois). Data collection included water-quality parameters; stable water isotopes; total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and chlorophyll-<em>a</em>; and fish community diversity and abundance. Results indicate that land cover in hay and pasture and decreased topographic relief in the local oxbow watersheds, along with reduced surface hydrologic connectivity, were related to an increase in total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and chlorophyll-<em>a</em>. Greater biodiversity and abundance in fish assemblages were evident in oxbow lakes that were more disconnected from the main channel. The results of this study suggest that local land cover, topography, and hydrologic connectivity to the main channel influence nutrients and fish communities. Knowing the influencing factors can help ecosystem managers better protect these valuable floodplain lake ecosystems and prioritize restoration efforts amidst increasing stressors due to climate and land-use changes.</p>","agricultural and biological engineering, floodplains, lake, wabash river, water quality, white river","Martha Carlson Mazur, Sara K McMillan, Bradley Smith, Broxton Bird, Mark Pyron, Cassie Hauswald"

The second part of the project aims for the data intern to train other graduate students on the use NVivo to support data management and analysis of qualitative data in biomedical systematic reviews and evidence syntheses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The data intern was trained by a Purdue University Libraries and School of Information Studies (PULSIS) faculty member. The PULSIS faculty determined the learning of the data intern by comparing the data intern&rsquo;s self-reported pre-and post- assessments on seventeen key traits of data literacy.</p>

<p>In turn, the data intern co-developed a 3-part workshop series for other graduate students in Purdue. The workshop used the flipped classroom model. The learning of the workshop participants was determined by comparing participants&rsquo; self-reported pre-and post- assessments on thirteen key traits of data literacy.</p>

<p>The Learning Priority Score for each trait, the Importance Score minus the Proficiency Score, was determined in both assessments. The scores ranged from -4 (very low learning priority) to +4 (very high learning priority).</p>

<p>The assessments of the data intern and workshop participants indicate net learning gains as their Learning Priority Scores were reduced.</p>

<p>Data management and analysis of qualitative data in biomedical systematic reviews and evidence syntheses are essential for graduate students in the health sciences. The materials and data from this project can serve as a resource for other training</p>

Once abundant, otters in Indiana were extirpated due to habitat losses and unregulated trapping, but subsequent reintroduction efforts were successful, and the population has expanded markedly since 1995. Unfortunately, due to the primarily piscine diet of otters, this demographic growth in Indiana has <a name=""_Hlk66779031"">led to conflict with stakeholders who are interested in recreational fisheries</a><a name=""_Hlk66779113"">.

We determined that our barcoding assay matched &gt;90% of our fish samples were assigned to the designated genus or species. We then dissected stomachs from 14 otter carcasses and performed multiple independent DNA extractions and metabarcoding sequencing reactions on the prey bolus from each stomach. Finally, we designated taxonomic assignments to prey by using an algorithm that clusters identical sequences into meaningful operational taxonomic units. We found nearly two dozen fish species represented in otter stomachs including some species of interest to recreational anglers, such as Largemouth Bass <em>Micropterus salmoides </em>and Bluegill <em>Lepomis macrochirus </em>(detected in 14% and 21% of the otter stomachs, respectively). The most common species represented were the Northern Hog Sucker <em>Hypentelium nigricans</em>, Stonerollers <em>Campostoma</em> <em>anomalum</em> or <em>C. oligolepis</em>, and various sunfishes.

These findings reveal a novel role for the zebrafish torus longitudinalis.","<p><strong>Background</strong>: A common feature of vertebrate visual systems is that lower-order and higher-order visual areas are reciprocally connected. Feedforward projections confer visual responsiveness to higher-order visual neurons while feedback projections likely serve to modulate responses of lower-order visual neurons in a context-dependent manner. Optic tectum is the largest first-order visual brain area in zebrafish and is reciprocally connected with the torus longitudinalis (TL), a second-order visual brain area that does not receive retinal input. A functional role for feedback projections from TL to tectum has not been identified.</p>

<p><strong>Results</strong>: In this study we demonstrate that TL feedback projections to tectum drive binocular integration and spatial summation in a defined tectal circuit. We performed genetically targeted, cell type-specific functional imaging in tectal pyramidal neurons (PyrNs) and their two input neuron populations: retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and neurons in TL. We find that PyrNs encode gradual changes in scene luminance using a complement of three distinct response classes that encode different light intensity ranges. Functional imaging of RGC inputs to tectum suggest that these response classes originate in the retina and RGC input specifies PyrN functional classes. In contrast, TL input serves to endow PyrNs with large, compound receptive fields that span both retinal hemifields.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> These findings reveal a novel role for the zebrafish TL in driving binocular integration and spatial summation in tectal PyrNs. The neurlal circuitry we describe generates a population of tectal neurons with large receptive fields tailored for detecting changes in the visual scene.</p>","biological sciences, fluorescence microscopy, matlab, neuroscience, research, vision, zebrafish","Estuardo Robles"

The lipid concentration in colostrum, however, is highly variable and little is known about its composition and maternal factors that influence its composition. The first objective was to measure plasma lipid composition of multiparous cows at 35 d before calving (<strong>BC</strong>; 35 &plusmn; 3 d; mean &plusmn; SD) and 7 d BC (7 &plusmn; 2 d), their colostrum, and serum lipid composition of calves (24 h postnatal) using multiple reaction monitoring (<strong>MRM</strong>) profiling, which is an exploratory and highly sensitive lipidomic analysis method that screens lipids based on chemical functionality. Secondly, data were analyzed to determine if there were relationships between circulating lipids in the cow, colostrum lipids, and calf serum lipids. Thirdly, relationships between markers of metabolic status of the cows and circulating and colostrum lipids were analyzed with correlation analysis. Blood was sampled and plasma prepared from multiparous cows (n=16) at 35 d and 7 d BC. Within 3 h of parturition, colostrum was collected from cows and fed to her calf. Calves received another feeding of colostrum within 12 h after birth and a serum sample was collected from each calf 24 h after the first feeding of colostrum. The metabolic status of cows was evaluated using insulin, glucose, and non-esterified fatty acid (<strong>NEFA</strong>) area under the curve (<strong>AUC</strong>) in response to an intravenous glucose tolerance test <strong>(IVGTT)</strong> performed at three wks BC. Lipids were extracted from plasma, colostrum and calf serum and analyzed using MRM profiling. Concentration of lipids were calculated using spiked in standards and expressed as percent of lipids identified. Data were uploaded into MetaboAnalyst 5.0 for multivariate and univariate analysis. Principal component analysis indicated that circulating lipids in the cow and calf were distinct from lipids in colostrum. Phosphatidylglycerol (<strong>PG</strong>) concentration was greater in colostrum and calf serum (<em>P</em> &lt; 0.05) than in cow plasma, with 23 of the 24 PGs found in colostrum also found in calf serum. In response to IVGTT in late gestation, NEFA AUC was positively related to total triacylglycerols (<strong>TG</strong>) lipids in 7 BC plasma (<em>r</em> = 0.63; <em>P </em>= 0.01) but negatively related to total membrane lipids in colostrum (<em>r</em> = -0.55; <em>P </em>= 0.03). Thus, the metabolic status of the dam influences circulating lipids and colostrum lipid content. Moreover, the circulating lipidome of the cow and calf are similar to one another and distinct from the colostrum lipidome, except for PG, where it appears that colostrum serves as the source for PG in the calf&rsquo;s circulation.</p>","animal sciences, bovine, colostrum, lipidome, metabolic status","Theresa M.

Drought severity in the San Joaquin River Valley, the area of California most impacted by the drought and whose impact drove the public conversation, was measured using the Standardized Soil Moisture Index, or SSI. SSI is a variant of the precipitation index, which uses streamflow instead of direct precipitation measurements. Streamflow is captured form rivers, streams, and other flowing bodies of water, which more accurately captures the precipitation that was directly captured by the soil. &nbsp;Regardless of the measurement method, the two indices are nearly identical, capturing the same data, which is the amount of water that is available in an area. The standardized soil moisture index is preferable because it is weighted toward capturing land drought severity.</p>

<p>In measurable terms, three-month SSI was calculated at five randomly selected locations using the soil moisture data obtained from NLDAS, NASA&rsquo;s North American Land Data Assimilation Systems dataset. Hourly soil moisture data from NLDAS spanning January 1980 through September 2015 was converted to monthly time series and entered the Standardized Precipitation Index calculator. Output containing the three-month SSI values was then used for further analysis. It is important to note that while SSI measures the severity of the drought, it provides only a baseline measure of how dramatic the real-life conditions were at each point during the crisis. However, by introducing the measure in the predictive model we do not assume that the media or information consumers reacted directly and consciously to it since the information was not publicly known. Rather, we consider that the worsening objective drought conditions created the environmental circumstances felt through a variety of personal experiences, especially dwindling water supplies in the homes and fields, that led to media concerns. SSI offers an assessment of the magnitude of the objective water shortage was, which created the backdrop of the crisis. SSI is the ultimate ground truth, against which we measure everything else, not a subjectively known quantity to which the human actors responded consciously.</p>

<p>We assessed the mediated response to the drought via the volume of Google searches related to the drought and Twitter activity and media coverage of the California water crisis. We collected data using a query algorithm with core strings &ldquo;California water&rdquo; and &ldquo;California drought.&rdquo; From Google Trends, we retrieved the volume of searches in California for &ldquo;California Water&rdquo; and &ldquo;California Drought&rdquo; for searches performed in California, which was the highest level of granularity available for this data. (Google can release a standardized index for search volume for any given period. The index is standardized on a 0-100 scale around the highest volume detected during the period of interest. Thus, the week with the highest volume is scored at 100, while everything else is calculated as a fraction of that week&rsquo;s score. (This method of standardization is intended to protect Google&rsquo;s commercial interest in the raw data.)</p>

<p>Using the Twitter Application Programming Interface (API), we retrieved the query ((climate OR drought OR water) (california OR ca)) OR cawater OR cadrought OR saveourwater.&nbsp; The query was more complex because it included several hashtags specific to Twitter (cawater, cadrought, and saveourwater). The pilot sampling process revealed that &ldquo;climate&rdquo; was also associated with the California drought crisis, further adding to query complexity. The query was limited in space to central California tweets geo-located by meta-data or in-text geographic identification. A total of 186,149 tweets were retrieved. The traditional media outlet selected was newspaper <em>The Modesto Bee</em>, an important regional newspaper covering the San Joaquin River Valley, the area most impacted by the crisis. The online newspaper archive was searched for articles containing the strings &ldquo;California water&rdquo; and &ldquo;California drought&rdquo; and 1,853 articles were retrieved.</p>

<p>Newspaper and Twitter data was cleaned for relevance and location. Non-relevant items were identified through hand-coding of a random sample of the collected items. We then applied a Multinomial Naive Bayesian algorithm to extend the classification made in the hand-coded items to the entire dataset. A Multinomial Naive Bayesian classifier uses word frequencies to characterize each document and then classifies the documents by comparing the similarity between frequency of word occurrence across documents (in this case articles of tweets). The averages of each accuracy metric with each class weighted to their prevalence in the data were:</p>

<p>Precision, .77, recall, .72, and F1, score .68, which are within the typical limits for reliability of this type of analysis. This is a widely used method, which provides robust results&nbsp;avoiding skewing the dataset with tweets related to water-heater troubles or water crises in other regions than California.</p>","agenda setting, chronic crisis, communication, drought, google trends, media, twitter","Robert Kulzic, Valeria Sinclair Chapman, Lauren Potts, Sorin Adam Matei"

Damage is a key mode of failure of civil infrastructure, components of the human body and subsurface storage sites, but it is of the highest importance for the success of enhanced energy production from geothermal and traditional subsurface reservoirs. As artificial intelligence methods advance in the detection of anomalous signals in data from sensors, methods are needed to link these readings to the underlying physics/mechanics of failure to determine if failure is imminent. This requires robust computational methods that capture the physics of failure and identify the measurable signatures of failure. While there are many computational approaches for simulating damage, few have been ground-truth tested with either known experimental data or with blind data sets.</p>

<p>Here, we provide&nbsp;<strong>a benchmark laboratory data</strong>&nbsp;set from&nbsp;<strong>3 point bending experiments</strong>&nbsp;for a damage mechanics challenge to compare computational approaches on damage evolution in brittle-ductile material. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The benchmark laboratory dataset&nbsp;includes measurements from traditional digital load-displacement sensors, 3D digital image correlation to map surface deformations, 3D X-ray microscopy to ground-truth the crack-failure geometry and notch geometry, and laser profilometry to capture surface roughness.</p>

<p>The samples were fabricated through additive manufacturing methods (e.g. 3D printing) to produce repeatable samples designed to fail in controlled ways. These methods were selected to ensure that participant-defined repeatable and unbiased metrics were available to quantitatively assess and measure the quality of the theoretical and data-driven models, given the significant influence of inherent uncertainty and variability on the onset and mode of failure. &nbsp;</p>

<p>3. identify model parameters that are currently not measured or cannot be measured in the laboratory; and</p>

<p>4. determine whether there are other experimental measurements that are needed or better methods of performing measurements to monitor damage evolution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This challenge exercise is used to determine the state of the art and future directions to improve the community&rsquo;s ability to simulate crack formation and evolution in natural and engineered brittle-ductile materials.&nbsp;The participants are asked to predict the forces and displacements required to initiate and propagate a crack in an additively manufactured specimen to predict failure load, crack propagation path length as a function of load, and fracture surface roughness.</p>

The variability of surface soil moisture (SSM) within three frequency bands (7 ~ 30 days, 30 ~ 90 days, and 90 ~ 365 days) after normalization is quantified using Fourier transform for the evaluation. Compared to the SMAP observations, the simulated SSM variability within CMIP5 is underestimated in the two higher frequency bands (by 72% and 56%, respectively) and overestimated in the lowest frequency band (by 113%). In addition, these differences concentrate in regions with larger SSM.

However, a challenge arises when multiply-scattered waves are not sufficiently separated in time from the direct arrivals to provide a clear coda wave train. Additional complications for monitoring changes in fracture systems arise when the signals originate from unsynchronized internal sources, such as natural induced seismicity, from acoustic emission, or from transportable intra-fracture sources (chattering dust), that generate uncontrolled signals that vary in arrival time, amplitude and frequency content. Here, we use a twin neural network (also known as a Siamese neural network) for dimensionality reduction to analyze signals from chattering dust to classify the fluid saturation state of a synthetic fracture system. The twin neural network with shared weights generates a low-dimensional representation of the data input by minimizing contrastive loss, serving as the input to a multiclass classifier that accurately classifies whether multiple fractures in a fracture system are fully saturated or partially saturated, or whether a change in saturation has occurred in different fractures in the system. These results show that information buried in unresolved codas from uncontrolled sources can be extracted using machine learning to monitor the evolution of fracture systems caused by physical and chemical processes even when the scattered and direct wave fields overlap.</p>

Here, we investigate the physicochemical properties of atmospheric particles collected on board a research aircraft flown over the Azores during the winter 2018 Aerosol and Cloud Experiment in the Eastern North Atlantic (ACE-ENA) campaign. Particles were collected within the marine boundary layer (MBL) and free troposphere (FT) after long-range atmospheric transport episodes facilitated by dry intrusion (DI) events. Chemical and physical properties of individual particles were investigated using complementary capabilities of computer controlled scanning electron microscopy and X-ray spectromicroscopy to probe particle external and internal mixing state characteristics. Furthermore, real-time measurements of aerosol size distribution, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration, and back-trajectory calculations were utilized to help bring into context the findings from offline spectromicroscopy analysis. While carbonaceous particles were found to be the dominant particle type in the region, changes in the percent contribution of organics across the particle population (i.e., external mixing) shifted from 68% to 43% in the MBL and from 92% to 46% in FT samples during DI events. This change in carbonaceous contribution is counterbalanced by the increase in inorganics from 32% to 57% in the MBL and 8% to 55% in FT. The quantification of the organic volume fraction (OVF) of individual particles derived from X-ray spectromicroscopy, which relates to the multi-component internal composition of individual particles, showed a factor of 2.06&plusmn;0.16 and 1.11&plusmn;0.04 increase in the MBL and FT, respectively, among DI samples. We show that supplying particle OVF into the к-K&ouml;hler equation can be used as a good approximation of field-measured &nbsp;in situ CCN concentrations.

<p>In this study, we identified recharge zones and groundwater flowpaths supporting springs east of the city of Arequipa and the potential for recharge within the high-elevation closed-basin Lagunas Salinas salar. We used general chemistry and isotopic tracers (&delta;<sup>18</sup>O, &delta;<sup>2</sup>H, and&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>H) in springs, surface waters (rivers and the salar), and precipitation (rain and snow) sampled from March 2019 through February 2020 to investigate these processes. We obtained monthly samples from six springs, bimonthly samples from four rivers, and various samples from high-elevation springs during the dry season. The monthly isotopic composition of spring water was invariable seasonally in this study and compared to published values from a decade prior, suggesting that the source of recharge and groundwater flowpaths that support springflow are relatively stable with time. The chemistry of springs in the low- and mid-elevations (2500 to 2900 masl) point towards a mix of recharge from the salar basin (4300 masl) and mountain-block recharge (MBR) in or above a que&ntilde;uales forest ecosystem at ~4000 masl on the adjacent Pichu Pichu volcano. Springs that clustered along the R&iacute;o Andamayo, including those at 2900 masl, had higher chloride concentrations indicating higher proportions of interbasin groundwater flow from the salar basin likely facilitated by a high degree of faulting along the R&iacute;o Andamayo valley compared to springs further away from that fault network. A separate groundwater flow path was identified by higher sulfate concentrations (and lower Cl<sup>-</sup>/SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-2</sup>&nbsp;ratios) within the Pichu Pichu volcanic mountain range separating the city from the salar. We conclude that the salar basin is not a hydrologic dead-end. Instead, it is a local topographic low where surface runoff during the wet season, groundwater from springs, and subsurface groundwater flowpaths from the surrounding mountains converge in the basin and some mixture of this water supports groundwater flow out of the salar basin via interbasin groundwater flow. In this arid location, high-elevation forests and the closed-basin salar are important sources of recharge supporting low-elevation springs. These features should be carefully managed to prevent impacts to the down-valley water quality and quantity.</p>","andes, arequipa, arequipa nexus institute, chemistry, eaps, groundwater, peru, recharge, salar, stable isotopes","Elizabeth Olson, Lisa R.

In this study, a no-cost online game (Stormslam) was used as an engagement tool in a general science hybrid course for non-meteorology majors at Purdue University in Spring 2021. In Stormslam, players engage in a virtual storm chasing, moving an imaginary vehicle around the continental United States at highway speeds and planting &ldquo;probes&rdquo; at designated drop sites. Scores are based on a combination of observed winds and precipitation at the sites. The purpose of integrating the game into the course was to create friendly competition between all learners (in-person and remote), improve weather forecasting skill, and improve awareness of current weather patterns. Students were further asked to distill their gameplay strategy into a short essay, which their classmates peer-reviewed. Survey responses indicated that the game increased students&rsquo; awareness of current weather, their forecasting skill, and helped them feel more engaged in the class. One limitation of this study is that respondents self-selected for those who played the game most often (two or more times per week). We offer our experience as a potential tool for instructors seeking to increase engagement in weather-focused courses.</p>","eaps, meteorology, teaching and learning","Loran Carleton Parker, Robin Lynn Tanamachi"

<p>The project &quot;Nutrient loading effects on fish habitat quality: Trade-offs between enhanced production and hypoxia in Lake Erie, North America&quot; aimed to understand the habitat quality trade-offs associated with increases in phosphorus in Lake Erie, a system with a history of anthropogenic nutrient loading.</p>

<p>Methods:</p>

<p>We used output from a water quality model and developed a bioenergetics growth rate potential (GRP) model to assess how habitat quality changed for 6 species and life stages across a range of phosphorus loading scenarios and across 19 different meteorological years.</p>

<p>Outcome:</p>

<p>Increases in phosphorus loading increased invertebrate prey biomass, but also increased the duration and extent of the mid-summer hypoxic zone. In general, phosphorus loading caused overall habitat quality to decline and only increased peak habitat quality (i.e., spatio-temporal locations where temperature and prey abundance were already above average), but responses were species- and life-stage specific. We additionally found that the negative effects of low oxygen on fish habitat quality appeared more severe if the prospect that increased hypoxia was accompanied by altered prey densities was not accounted for. Despite modeled responses to altered phosphorus loads, habitat quality responded more strongly to variation in annual meteorological conditions.</p>

<p>Application:</p>

<p>Our results provide further indication for why nutrient abatement programs may not lead to obvious, rapid positive habitat quality responses, as short-term meteorological effects may overwhelm effects related to nutrient reduction and changes in prey densities may partially offset the benefits of decreased hypoxic conditions.</p>

Increased temperatures may also interact with other anthropogenic stressors, such as chemical contaminants, to exacerbate or reduce parasite transmission. However, studies on the effects of pesticides on non-target species are typically conducted at one standard temperature, despite the toxicity of many agrochemicals being temperature-dependent. Furthermore, most studies assessing the effects of temperature on pesticide toxicity have been conducted on host organisms, limiting our understanding of how temperature affects the toxicity of pesticides to free-living parasite stages as they move through the environment in search of a host. Using the free-swimming cercariae stage of the trematode <em>Echinostoma trivolvis</em>, we <a name=""_Hlk86318995"">examined </a>how the toxicities of three different pesticides (a carbamate insecticide, strobilurin fungicide, and triazine herbicide) vary by temperature by monitoring cercarial swimming activity over time. Our three main findings were: 1) a strong main effect of temperature across all pesticide trials &ndash; higher temperatures caused cercariae to cease swimming activity earlier, likely due to an increased rate of energy expenditure, 2) atrazine, azoxystrobin, and carbaryl were directly toxic to cercariae to some degree, but not in a predictable dose-dependent manner, and 3) the temperature at which pesticide exposure occurs could affect its toxicity to cercariae. The interaction between pesticide and temperature was most evident in the azoxystrobin exposure; azoxystrobin caused cercariae to cease swimming activity earlier at 30 &deg;C but caused cercariae to maintain swimming activity longer at 18 &deg;C relative to their respective pesticide-free control treatments. These findings highlight the importance of conducting toxicity assays at multiple temperatures and suggest that the combined effects of pesticides and temperature on host-parasite interactions may be difficult to generalize.</p>","echinostomatidae, ecotoxicology, forestry and natural resources, fungicide, herbicide, insecticides, parasite, survival analysis","Jason T.

Efficient and non-destructive hyperspectral imaging can quantify plant physiological traits under abiotic stresses; however, prediction models generally are developed for few genotypes of one species, limiting the broader applications of this technology. Therefore, the objective of this research was to explore the possibility of developing cross-species models to predict physiological traits (relative water content and nitrogen content) based on hyperspectral reflectance through partial least square regression for three genotypes of sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i> (L.) Moench) and six genotypes of corn (<i>Zea mays</i> L.) under varying water and nitrogen treatments. Multi-species models were predictive for relative water content of sorghum and corn (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.809), as well as for nitrogen content of sorghum and corn (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.637). Reflectances at 506, 535, 583, 627, 652, 694, 722 and 964 nm were responsive to the changes in relative water content while the reflectances at 486, 521, 625, 680, 699 and 754 nm were responsive to changes in nitrogen content. High-throughput hyperspectral imaging can be used to predict physiological status of plants across genotypes and some similar species with acceptable accuracy.</p>","abiotic stress, agronomy, corn, ecophysiology, high-throughput phenotyping, machine learning, nitrogen content, partial least square regression, relative water content, remote sensing, sorghum","Meng-yang Lin, Mitchell R Tuinstra"

<p>Abstract: &quot;This work evaluates how well Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) models reproduce the climatology of North American SCS environments in ERA5 reanalysis and examines what drives biases across models. Biases in Springtime SCS environments vary widely in magnitude and spatial pattern, but most models do well in reproducing the climatological pattern and a few also reproduce the overall magnitude. SCS bias is driven by bias in extreme CAPE. This bias is ultimately found to be driven by bias in mean-state near-surface moist static energy (MSE), indicating that the SCS environments depend strongly on the near-surface mean state. Results are broadly similar to Spring across all seasons, particularly Summer. Biases differ strongly across parent models but weakly across child models of the same parent. These outcomes help identify models well-suited for studying climate effects on SCS environments and also provide a foundation for improving model performance in the future.&quot;</p>","climate modeling, eaps, earth and atmospheric sciences, severe convective storms, thunderstorm","Daniel Robert Chavas, Funing Li"

The cellular mechanisms related to this...","<p>In this study we utilize a class-based small molecule-focused approach to evaluate the paracrine interaction of preimplantation embryos (or simply their environment) with mouse prostate carcinoma cells (RM-1) and the effect of their close contact on the cancer cell metabolism. For this assessment we surveyed the lipid profiles of the cancer cells upon (i) co-incubation with two-cell embryos throughout the blastocyst stage or (ii) exposure to deproteinated blastocyst extracts, and compared them with untreated RM-1 cells. Additionally, we correlated these small-molecule profiles with the gene expression levels of SOX-2, a transcription factor commonly related to cell stemness properties. Our initial results demonstrate that both treatments (co-culture with preimplantation embryos or with deproteinated blastocyst extracts) induce changes in SOX-2 expression levels as well as in the quantities/production of specific acyl-carnitines, diacylglycerols, phospholipids, and cardiolipins in the RM-1 cells. This indicates that the <i>in vitro</i> system used to expose cancer cells to a mimicry of early embryonic environment allowed biochemical interaction between embryos and RM-1 cells. Further, it shows that the small molecules secreted by blastocysts, and their extracts, are bioactive and induce metabolic changes in cancer cells. We expect this <i>in vitro</i> model, as well as our analytical methodology, to be useful tools in order to obtain new insights into the paracrine stem cell communication pathways that play a role in CSC differentiation.</p>

PFAS are regularly detected in surface waters, but their effects on many aquatic organisms are still poorly understood. Species with thyroid-dependent development, like amphibians, can be especially susceptible to PFAS effects on thyroid hormone regulation. We examined sublethal effects of aquatic exposure to four commonly detected PFAS on larval northern leopard frogs (<em>Rana [Lithobates] pipiens</em>), American toads (<em>Anaxyrus americanus</em>), and eastern tiger salamanders (<em>Ambystoma tigrinum</em>). Animals were exposed for 30 days (frogs and salamanders) or until metamorphosis (toads) to 10, 100, or 1,000 mg/L of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), or 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS). We measured effects on survival, body condition and development, We determined that chronic exposure to common PFAS can negatively affect amphibian body condition and development at concentrations as low as 10 ug/L. These effects were highly species-dependent, with species having prolonged larval development (frogs and salamanders) being more sensitive to PFAS than more rapidly developing species (toads). Our results demonstrate some species could experience sublethal effects at sites with surface waters highly affected by PFAS. Our results also indicate that evaluating PFAS toxicity using a single species is not sufficient for accurate amphibian risk assessment. Future studies are needed to determine whether these differences in susceptibility can be predicted from species life histories and determine whether more commonly occurring environmental levels of PFAS could affect amphibians.&nbsp;</p>","amphibians, forestry and natural resources, frogs, pfas, pfoa, pfos, salamanders, toads","Gary Hoover, Jason T.

Emerging capacities for conducting large-scale extension training using information and communication technologies (ICTs) now afford opportunities for generating the rich datasets needed to analyze situational factors that affect women&rsquo;s participation.&nbsp; Data was recorded from 1,070 video-based agricultural extension training events (131,073 farmers) in four Administrative Divisions of Bangladesh (Rangpur, Dhaka, Khulna, and Rajshahi).&nbsp; The study statistically analyzed the effect of gender of the trainer, time of the day, day of the week, month of the year, Bangladesh Administrative Division, and venue type on (1) the total number of extension event attendees and (2) the number of females attending. The study revealed strong gender specific training preferences.&nbsp; Several factors that increased total participation, decreased female attendance (e.g., male-led training event held after 3:30 pm in Rangpur). These findings highlight the dilemma faced by extension trainers seeking to maximize attendance at training events while avoiding exacerbating gender inequalities. The study concludes with a discussion of ways to mitigate gender exclusion in extension training by extending data collection processes, incorporating machine learning to understand gender preferences, and applying optimization theory to increase total participation while concurrently improving gender inclusivity.</p>

The monochromatic beam measurements are included as raster-scanned point measurements from a singular line of sight, with additional views gained by translating and rotating the spray across the fixed beam allowing for non-spatiotemporally correlated 2D planar reconstructions from the 7-BM beamline at the Advanced Photon Source synchrotron facility. The measurements are evaluated for two main operating modes of impinging jet sprays, including an open liquid rim and an impact wave condition with typical Reynolds numbers of ~6,700&ndash;7,100 and ~10,100&ndash;10,600, respectively.</p>

<p>The accompanying journal publication (submission pending)&nbsp;compares the liquid mass distribution measurements made from the two distinct setups. Detailed instructions on how these raw datasets can be converted into quantitative path length measurements and reconstructed into volumetric and planar gridded data can be found in the accompanying GitHub repository (doi:&nbsp;<a href=""http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6383545"">10.5281/zenodo.6383545</a>).
